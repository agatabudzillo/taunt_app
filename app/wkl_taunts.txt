(ENTER ARCHEOLOGIST 1 & 2)
ARCHEOLOGIST 1: Dr. Jones, looks like we’ve found an ancient Viking burial site, from the Ballhalla clan.
ARCHEOLOGIST 2: This must be the site of Ragnacock… when they all lost they dicks.
ARCHEOLOGIST 1: It appears that all of the Vikings are trapped in the scissors formation characteristic of the traditional Norse “Fuck Pile.” Except for this one over here all by himself, burnt to a crisp. I wonder what could have happened…
ARCHEOLOGIST 2 (hand to chin): Yes, I wonder…
ARCHEOLOGIST 1 & 2: Doodle ee doo… doodle ee doo… (transition to flashback)
(EXEUNT ARCHEOLOGIST 1 & 2. Vikings come to life, BALLHALLANS 1 & 2 are scissoring while all 3 are cheering and hollering.)
PAUL: BALLHALLANS! As the prophecy has foretold, when the golden star rises in the south, Ragnacock is upon us! And look, behold!
(Enter PAUL or JASON wearing a Timbers jersey & scarf with a sign with a gold star on it that reads “2015 MLS Champions”.)
PAUL: So what enemies shall we battle on this glorious day of Ragnacock?
BALLHALLAN 1: Stroki! Today we face the Bloc Rockers on the field of kickball battle! And what the fuck is a Ragnacock?
BALLHALLAN 2: It’s the end of Ballhalla, the day when we lose all our dicks! Before this day, we have been omnipotent, but after today… we shall be impotent!
PAUL: Onto the longboat, and we shall – ahem - “race the boat” (All BALLHALLANS open a can or gesture with water bottles) East to fight our Russian foes!
(Some sort of weird sailing sight gag, then they land next to a couple BLOC ROCKERS next to the BLOC ROCKER.)
PAUL: I expected an army! What the fuck is this shit! This is fucking stupid! In Ballhalla, when we want to do a taunt, like we’ve been saying for weeks now, we show you a generic stereotype about your team, and then make fun of that stereotype, so I’m gonna have to take my pants off—
(ENTER CHRIS HANSEN)
CHRIS HANSEN: No, you should keep those on, Stroki. Hi, I’m Chris Hansen, and you’re on To Catch a Pillager.
(sets down a folding chair)
CHRIS HANSEN: Why don’t you have a seat for me?
PAUL (sits): What the fuck is this shit? This is fucking stupid! I don’t understand, I swear I’ve never done this before, this is all a big misunderstanding—
CHRIS HANSEN: No, that is the problem Stroki. You have done this exact taunt before, and we have it on video. Just go to Facebook, and you’ll see this is at least the 4th or 5th time you’ve done it. You walk in, you say “What the fuck is this shit? This is fucking stupid! This is how Vikings do it…”
PAUL: But the Hell Razors do the same taunt every week as well! You know, a weak skit entirely supporting a parody song…
CHRIS HANSEN: Yeah, they do do that, but they’re funny, and they have props. But you’re right, that’s shitty and repetitive too. So give me your script.
PAUL: I don’t wanna.
CHRIS HANSEN: Give me the script!
PAUL: No, I don’t wanna!
CHRIS HANSEN: No, Stroki, you have to stop abusing the trope. This taunt formula is so old that it belongs in a museum. 
ARCHEOLOGIST 1 and/or 2 YELL FROM OFF STAGE: IT BELONGS IN A MUSEUM!
CHRIS HANSEN: And now we’re gonna lay it, and you, to rest.
PAUL: Well, can I go out like a Viking?
CHRIS HANSEN: You mean, you want to get lit on fire in a boat? 
PAUL: Yes… 
CHRIS HANSEN: Okay, just Ballhobble on over there then.
(Paul limps over to the boat.)
CHRIS HANSEN: You promise you’ll never do this taunt again?
PAUL: Yeah, I promise!
CHRIS HANSEN: And you want to go out like a Viking?
PAUL: Yeah! A big, scary Viking!
CHRIS HANSEN: Then it’s time to be cleansed in the fires… of RAGNACOCK! (ALL IN BACKGROUND START AIR GUITARING WHILE YELLING METAL JUNT JUNT JUNTS and chanting “Ragnacock! Ride the cock!” in metal voice. Chris Hansen pours out some Fireball over PAUL. Then he lights a match and throws it at him. Flame fx using the flame props.)
CHRIS HANSEN: Ballhallans! We now lay this shitty taunt idea to rest! And now, you shall join us, as everyone must partake in the fires of Ragnacock!
(Metal shit continues. Hand out shots of Fireball to everyone.) 

(SCENE: Large wrestling ring. Announcers off to the side.)
ANNOUNCER 2:  For the thousands in attendance, for the millions around the world watching this on Facebook, ladies and gentlemen, the World Wide West Coast Kickball Wrestling League proudly presents our 30th main event, a tag team, whip-it cream, possibly drag queen match, pin ‘em to win royal rumble. So…
ANNOUCERS 1 & 2: LEEEEEEET’S GET READY TO RUMBLE!
(lots of smoke and fan fair. A group “sings” the “Ya’ll ready for this” wrestling song: https://youtu.be/VOvDTCbcHe0?t=17s )
ANNOUNCER 1: Well, let’s start this off! Our first contestant for WWWKWLXXX is coming down the ramp now, standing in at six foot nothing in heels, the dopest pope that ever doped, coming off a four year steroids ban, it’s… Pope Purkey!  He’s got a direct line to god, but must have done something to offend him because our kickball games keep getting rained out!
(POPE PURKEY gets in the ring to much fanfare, a group of folks sing “all righty then” behind him: https://youtu.be/WhI_SDEvJ-4?t=14s   He goes to his corner and acts all dopey popey)
POPE PURKEY (acting authentically nice): Thank you, thank you, I just hope everybody has a good time tonight and has a lot of fun.
ANNOUNCER 2: Yeah, what’s up with this weather? At this rate, we’re gonna be playing the 2017 season on an ark!
ANNOUNCER 1: Round up all the furries!
ANNOUNCER 2: Oh no, coming down the ramp now, we have our second contestant.  She’s sure to NOT be the crowd’s favorite.  Weighing in at 110lbs, with 20 lbs of stick up her ass, It’s craaazy neighbor lady and her herd of cats!  Let’s me hear you make a whole lot of noise for the lady who considers this public park HER yard.
(CRAZY NEIGHBOR LADY comes in to much crazy fanfare and Singing. She gets to her corner and acts crazy)
All singing: Crazy Neighbor Lady, Crazy Neighbor Lady, Crazy Neighbor Lady, Crazy Neighbor Lady… put your tents down.
CNL: That’s right, there’s not any tents allowed, there’s not any amplification allowed, there’s not any booze allowed, there’s not any smoking allowed, there’s not any fun allowed. Not tonight! Not in my yard!
ANNOUNCER 2 (eating a sandwich and talking with his mouth full): She’s a real delight to be around.
ANNOUNCER 1:  Well, look at these sad sacks of shit.  Looks like these two have to play three quarters of an entire kick ball season in less than 3 weeks.  It’s the dudes with pubes on their cubes, the pube dudes with a bunch of noobs, it TKO’s… Miles and Durst!
(MILES and DURST come in with umbrellas and pillows to very tired fanfare. They go to their corner and take a nap)
DURST: Man, I forgot how exhausting kickball was.
MILES: Yeah, the only way this season could be more tiring is if we weren’t getting carried through every game by all our rookies.
ANNOUNCER 2: And here comes the gruesome twosome that you wanna do some. It’s the sexational, inspirational, exceptional, intellectual polish pounder, the lady with the iron meat curtains, the lovers from soviet mothers…
(Cyril and Agata come in to much sexy fanfare. They get to their corner and make out.)
ANNOUNCER 2: Oh hot damn! 
ANNOUNCER 1: Yes it’s Axl Hammer and Sickle Slash.
REFEREE: Okay, this is a royal rumble, once you’ve been pinned for a three count, you’re out, last team standing takes home the belt. (hold up belt) I want a good fight, not a clean fight. Now that we’re ready… Leeeeeet’s actually rumble!
ANNOUNCER 1: And they’re off, it looks like the lovers from Soviet mothers are busy sucking face, but TKO is too busy counting sheep to get any action either--
ANNOUNCER 2: --TKO can’t get any action? What else is new? AYOOOOOOO. It looks like it’s CNL and the pope to start us off.
FIGHT 1
DURING FIGHTS: ANNOUNCERS generally are reacting – wincing, “OH SHIT!” “That’s gotta hurt!” &c.
POPE offers his hand to CRAZY NEIGHBOR LADY, CNL kicks him in the dick. POPE falls to his knees, gets punched in the face and falls down. CNL does a boo hiss victory lap.
CNL: Down with fun! Up with early bedtimes!
Comes up behind the POPE, chokes him out. POPE breaks free and does the ultimate fighting move (blow to the stomach to break the head lock, then a punch to the face, then a hit to the groin, then a punch to the face then a hit to the groin etc). POPE pins CNL while Ref pounds the count on the mat. She rolls out.
REF: She’s down for the count! Congratulations on beating up an old lady, and that isn’t creepy or weird at all!
POPE begins to pray.
POPE: Our father Hiram, who art in Texas, shallow be his game… deliver us this day our daily brisket, and forgive us our thread deleting. And lead us not into getting super-butthurt, but deliver us from boring taunts….
FIGHT 2
TKO wakes up and watches the action.
MILES: Art thou bored? SNAP INTO A SLIM JIM! (Throws Slim Jims to audience)
Once the POPE prays TKO double clothesline the POPE.  POPE falls to the ground and TKO kicks the POPE as he tries to crawl away. POPE sits up, his hat knocked off, MILES drags him by the hair to a corner, where they punch him in the face three times.
DURST: Somebody call the Cardinals! ‘Cuz when we’re done, it’s gonna be time for a new… PAPAL CONCLAVE.
POPE is then thrown into the middle of the ring, MILES sits on the POPE’s face, DURST sits on his crotch, they pin him while the ref pounds the count on the mat.
REF: And heeeee’s out! 
MILES: OH, YEAHHHHH!
FIGHT 3
CYRIL and AGATA stop making out for like 3 seconds and see what’s going on. They both kick MILES and DURST off of the POPE.
MILES: OH, NO!
They both slap the shit out of them in opposite corners.  AGATA swings around MILES, CYRIL swings around DIRST, and DURST and MILES collide in the middle of the ring. CYRIL and AGATA do the Hamish hammer finishing move.  They win.
CYRIL: Huh, in America, your wrestlers tell you to snap into a slim jim (throws slim jims out to the crowd).  In Russia, you suck on my fat borris.  (big old pickle joke) 

(SCENE: opens with a generic WKL person walking around looking at their phone. Bloc Rocker comes up to them.)
Russian Trainer: Hello Comrade of the WKL.  We have heard of game that is sweeping the world, Pokemon Go.  We hear is very popular. Well in Russia, we have much better game called Poke-a-Witch Go. Or Witchey-mon Go. Or Baba Yaga, No! Name is not important
Player: Um, that sounds… fun? Do you have to catch the witches?
Trainer: No, individual ownership is crime against the proletariat. You have to burn the witches, burn them all.
Player: (Looking at phone). I’m not seeing it on the app store?
Trainer: Is not available on capitalist pig Steve Jobs app store. You must go to the people’s app store. Here, give me phone. (Takes phone and taps around). There, now we just need to wait in queue for our turn to download.
Hands phone back to player. Long pause.
Player: OK, so I have the app running.  I’ve made a witch burner, and now it’s thinking… thinking… okay! Wait, no… thinking… here we go!
(A matt hasting appears.)
Trainer: This is a Hasting Witch, don’t worry is very basic.
Player: Okay, so, how do I neutralize a basic witch?
Enter scientist
Scientist:  Actually, neutralizing a basic witch is very easy - <basic scientific explanation of acid blah blah>
Exit scientist
Player: Okay, so…?
Trainer:  So now you just throw penta-balls at him until he burns. They’re made of vinyl records. Basic Witches are suckers for anything on vinyl.
Player throws pentaball at Hastings. Hastings spins and screams.
Player:  Burn witch! Get out the way, get out the way witch, get out the way! 
Russian Prop Person: CHEMICAL BURN!
Player: That was awesome, but now I’m out of Pentaballs?  What do I do?
Trainer: Well, look at map, see blue beacon? Is Pentastop, we walk there-
Both walk over to Honey Bucket
Trainer: Okay, now you spin icon, get pentaballs and other treats.
Player: Easy enough. 
Player spins the porta potty sign, out comes penta balls and a big poop
Player: Cool I got pentaballs and this big brown squishy egg thing, and it smells-
Trainer:  Like shit? 
Player: (Disgusted) Yes…
Trainer: Is shit.
Prop Person: Shitty BURN!
Player:  Awww gross!  (looks at phone) Okay, let’s go find some witches. (they walk over to the sand pit) Goddamnit, this game sucks, there aren’t any basic witches anywhere.  What is it, slightly drizzling out or something?
Trainer: Well, you should use a lure. 
Player: How do I get a lure?
Trainer: Just give me credit card… Actually, never mind, you’re logged in with Google, I already have it.  Here’s your lure. (pulls PBR out of pocket) Just set down this PBR, some basic witches are sure to appear.
Player: (sets down PBR and waves hands over it) Calling all the basic witches, calling all the basic witches.  This just in… you’re basic.
(Scottyzar and Mammachu appear)
Trainer: Look! Is Scottyzar and Mammachu
Scottyzar: I quit the league! I quit my job! I quit! I quit!
Mammachu: Not the Mamma!  Not the mamma!
Trainer: How do I neutralize these two?
Russian: I think you need to use something they both want. Try spawning the spawn.
(Player does something on phone, in walks Fergie with Hamish in a dress)
MammaChu: Cute baby!  Cute baby!
Scottyzar:  Woah, whose daughter is that? She’s fierce
Trainer: Quick! While they’re distracted-
(Player throws penta balls at the two, they come out of records labeled something from our first taunt, both Scottyzar and Mamachu are disabled)
Fergie: I think I’m going to become a Satanist, just for the hell of it.
Prop Person: Dad Joke Burn!
Player: Hey look over there, it’s like a big boss, in some sort of tower, what is that?
Trainer: Oh, is the old timey Jim.  There won’t be any basic witches there. They’re just not on his level any more.
(3 people wander around looking at their phones)
Player: (Pointing at phone people). Look at all those ass holes just looking at their phones.
Trainer: Yes, this game is more popular than Jasmin at biker bar.  Because, you know, she’s really fun to hang out with, at bars.  And she sometimes hangs out with people who ride motorcycles. And motorcycles are fun.
Player: Okay, so are there any legendary witches here?
Trainer: No, they all basic. 

(SCENE: BLOC ROCKER is on stage, under a sheet hiding a pile of books.)
Two Breeders stagger in, frustrated and in pain.
BREEDER 1 (wincing in pain): Oh my god, I’m so sore.
BREEDER 2 (eating chocolate): I’m so bloated. I can’t even get out of this suit. I’m just gonna lay down like this for the rest of the week.
BREEDER 1: It isn’t just us, the entire team is being taken down by this red menace.  McCarthy was right, there are communists everywhere, and they’re taking us out one by one.
BREEDER 2: I know, first we lost Commie Mike… I mean, obviously we were gonna lose Commie Mike, he’s a goddamn commie.
BREEDER 1: Then we lost the scarlet letter. Not surprising, she really loves red and red is kind of the whole communist thing.
BREEDER 2: But then we lost Luke, I think he drove his electric trike off a cliff in a fit of red rage.
BREEDER 1: Yeah, but he was such a cock potato, he’d always get mashed at games and during taunts he’d just be fried.  Hell, I think he was just a little bit tattered.
BREEDER 2: Cock potoato? Because he forces us to recite his terrible puns?
BREEDER 1: No, I  mean, he’s a dick-tater.
BREEDER 2: A dick-tater? I thought he was a spud-dick.
BREEDER 1: Goddamnit his terrible puns have infected us all faster than pokemon go.
Enter BREEDER 3. Looking okay.
BREEDER 3: Hey guys, what’s wrong?
BREEDER 2:  Our vaginas are weeping and we can’t stop making terrible puns…
BREEDER 3: Wait, is Aunt Flow visiting you too?
BREEDER 1: Yeah, it’s shark week and this entire league is afraid to get in the water if you know what I mean.
BREEDER 2: Megashark vs giant flow-topus over here.
BREEDER 1: We’ll be redder than a Stark wedding!
BREEDER 2: Bloodier than the elevator shaft in the Shining!
BREEDER 3: Surfing the Crimson Wave?
BREEDER 1: Red Tide!
BREEDER 2: Riding the cotton pony.
BREEDER 3: Have we all fallen to the communists?
BREEDER 1: Yes. It is that time of the month.
(ENTER AGATA, in Marie Antoinette outfit)
AGATA: Oh, I just LOVE period pieces!
(EXIT AGATA)
BREEDER 2: Well, the bleeding’s fine but I am sick of being closed for maintenance!
BREEDER 3: Yeah, if I don’t get laid we’ll be Bleeding Rainbow. We need to solve this, and FAST.
(ENTER BLOC ROCKER LIBRARIAN. LIBRARIAN pulls table cloth off of BLOC ROCKER to reveal a shelf of books.)
LIBRARIAN: You know, whenever I can’t get laid, I just find a good fantasy… uh, novel.
BREEDER 3: That’s right! Just take a look, it’s in a book! Let’s read some clit-erature!
LIBRARIAN: Why not try something from our sexist re-education section? For instance, we have Flolita, Red Dawn, and the Cunnalingus Manifesto over here.
(BRODSKY laughs from audience. “IS FUNNY RUSSIAN JOKE!”)
BREEDER 1: Ooh, the Hunt For Red Cocktober! Das Cock and Balls!
BREEDER 2: Oh wow, look at these great movies! Das Booty and The Battleship Poon-Tempting!
BREEDER 3: A Red River Runs Through It, and Where The Red Pad Goes.
LIBRARIAN: Let me recommend a personal favorite… Menstrual Farm! This book teaches that “red wings good, no wings bad”. So really, all of you must band together and realize that a dick-tater isn’t the way to go. You might all feel a little bloated and crampy right now but you can relish in the solidarity that you all have red wings and those red wings will help you rise up and fly higher than a triple rainbow. 

(Enter Fergie:   )
FERGIE (singing):
When you bleed I can fly
With these red wings I’ll touch the sky
Plow through the red tide every night and day.
Even if you say no… wait I learned that that is NOT okay.

We can cuddle if you’re sore
Or I can go in through the back door
Think of me as your meat tampon,
And let me spread your meat cur-tons
Then we can go out for a steak
‘Cuz you’ll need to up your iron intake
ALL:
When you bleed we will fly
Digging deep into your bloody thighs.
Thanks to you our crotches look tie dyed.
We can pleasure your bloody vee
And please don’t worry we got new sheets

Hand out Cris’ tampon jello shots.
FIN

(Enter LEIF & JONATHAN)
LEIF:		Oh wow, I can’t believe we beat the shit out of TKO AND Baewatch!
JONATHAN:	Oh shit wrong script! (swap scripts)
LEIF:		Hey, sooooo we’re running really late to the Festival of Losers.
JONATHAN:	Yeah, sometimes I get really bummed about playing in the Festival of Losers EVERY YEAR but I just love the WKL soooo much!
(Walk up to scoreboard with SOFT TACO PENIS QUIET and COMPLICATED CHRISTIANS signs)
LEIF:	Some joker swapped out our placard just like on the taunt trophy! “Soft Taco Penis Quiet,” huh.
JONATHAN:	That’s weird… Hey, it’s the witches over there. Are you ready for the Festival of Losers?
SARAH:	“Festival of Losers?” What’s that? It’s Championship Day – get ready tacos, because you’re playing our team—the Complicated Christians—in the first game! 
JASMINE:	Why would you celebrate losers? Kickball is serious business!
SARAH:	The bottom two teams are relegated to go play in Overcat, this junior league where they sing songs and drink beer and act like a bunch of children.
JASMINE:	Yeah, it’s disgusting!
LEIF (pulls JONATHAN aside):	Did you hear what they just said? We’re playing in Championship day! Do you know what that means?
JONATHAN:	YES! Obviously, we’re trapped in some Bizarro world mirror universe where everything is the opposite of our world!
ALL:	DUN DUN DUN!
LEIF (To CHRISTIANS):	Hey! So we’ve never been to Championship day. What are the rules?
SARAH:	Well, it’s just like the rules for every other kickball game.
JONATHAN:	Yeah… so… what are the rules to kickball, again?
JASMINE:	Well, it’s complicated, like the love of Christ. 
SARAH:	Yeah, you should probably go to TKO for that. 
LEIF:		Oh! So The Kickball Order is here?
JASMINE:	No, The Kickball Originals! They’ve been in the league forever – some say they invented the sport of kickball itself! Amen.
(Team travels to the Kickball Originals.)
SARAH and JASMINE:	May the Lord be with you.
(EXIT SARAH and JASMINE)
(Kickball Original with cane)
TKO: 		Welcome young bucks! Welcome to the bizarro world! Oh no, Oh no.
JONATHAN:	Wait, do you know who we are?
TKO:		Oh no. Oh no.
LEIF:		Don’t you mean “OH YEAH”?
TKO: 	Oh no. But you are not the first WKL team to come in my realm. The last one was Amathong. I’m afraid they never made it back.
(Find Paul in crowd. We point to the actual Paul in the crowd. )
JONATHAN:	Wait, is that Paul? Do you have a Balhalla here? We have one of those in our world!
TKO:	Yeah, I know, some things are the same in both universes.
LEIF:	I guess the opposite of zero… is still zero.
JONATHAN:	So how do we get back you our world?
TKO:	Even I do not know, but Neutered and Shorn will be your guide. He can take you to the most wretched hive of scum and villainy in Fremont… the Hostile Hostel.
(NEUTERED AND SHORN leads them to HOSTILE HOSTEL. GNO is walking out, carrying Awesome Prop.)
GNO:		Hey guys, I’m going to bed… you know, Bro’s Night Alone. I’m just tired from our amazing taunt full of super-awesome props.
(Enter Hostile Hostel.)
(Enter LUKE.)
LEIF:		Hey, it’s Luke! Aren’t you glad this place isn’t the Dubliner anymore?
LUKE: 		Huh?
LEIF: 		You know, since you got 86’ed for pouring your outside beer into their inside can?
LUKE: 	Beer? Never touch the stuff. Clean and healthy living for this guy – I’m definitely gonna live past 40. How else are you going to be the best kickball sports team of all time?! This is a milk and cookie bar. The lines are so great here – you can wait in them for hours.
(Waitress comes out with Oreo cookie jello shots for the audience.)
JONATHAN:	Oh, you get to stand in line for a really long time and then you get meager rations? Oh, it’s just like Mother Russia!
LUKE: 		Oh fiddlesticks, it’s almost 6:30, we’ve got to get going soon!
LEIF: 		Why? Is it last call?
LUKE: 	No, it’s time for everyone to go to bed! Except for Heidi and Andrea, those crazy party animals who are always up all night!
(Enter DANNY)
DANNY:		Hey guys, you left before we won!
JONATHAN: 	Wait what?
DANNY: 	Our team! Soft Taco Penis Quiet! We just beat the Heaven’s Ravers for the kickball championship!
JONATHAN: 	Danny Cifaldi? You’re on our team?
DANNY: 	No, I’m Dani Nelson! Leif’s gay lover! From the South! Of course I’m on your team, I’m so super-loyal I would never leave your team! Especially not to join a team with TICE TICE OLD MAN or BUTTERFINGERS EMORY or DUBS.
(LEIF and DANNY MAKE OUT, TONGUE WOULD REALLY SELL IT).
LEIF: 		I could stay here forever!
(ENTER BOO-LEEN with sign that says “COOL-LEEN”)
BOO-LEEN: 	Alright, Curfew Crew! It’s time to go to bed!
JONATHAN: 	What, Coolz? Why would you say that?
BOO-LEEN: 	What, who’s “Coolz”? I’m BOO-LEEN! (flips sign to “BOO-LEEN”) I’m the Commissioner’s enforcer! I’m here to say boo on drinking, boo on fun, boo on each and every one! Because kickball is serious business!
LEIF: 		Wait, but fun is the most important part of kickball!
MEAN-A (off stage): 	DID SOMEONE SAY FUN?!?
BOO-LEEN: 	Oh, you’ve done it now. Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.
(ENTER COMMISSIONER MEAN-A. EVERYONE in the bar but LUKE runs away.)
MEAN-A: 	There will be none of the fun while I’m in charge! No hugging allowed!
LUKE: 		Run! It’s the commissioner!
LEIF:		Tina’s the commissioner?
LUKE: 		That’s not Tina! That’s Mean-a! The meanest commissioner of all! 
JONATHAN:	Wait, I know exactly how to stop Mean-a! Our Tina loves karaoke more than anything! It’s in her DNA, and I should know because I’m a scientist!
LEIF: 		Yeah, I brought my Magic Mike double XL with me! That’ll do it!
(Leif pulls out giant microphone)
(MEAN-A rips it out of his hands and rips it in half.)
MEAN-A: 	I! HATE! KARAOKE!
LEIF & JONATHAN & LUKE:	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
JONATHAN:	We’re doomed!
LEIF: 	Wait, wait! I know exactly what’ll stop Tina! We need ripped abs! Who will have really ripped abs in this bizarro world?
JONATHAN:	Fergie! We need Bizarro Fergie!
(Enter JACOB)
JACOB:		Do you mean me? I’m Jergie!
LEIF: 		We need you to take off your shirt!
JACOB: 		I’m not really into that. I would really like it if you all stopped objectifying me.
JONATHAN: 	But you need to! For the good of the league!
(JACOB takes off his shirt.)
MEAN-A: 	Noooo I can’t handle such amazing abs! The horror! The horror! I’m melting! I’m melting!
(JONATHAN & LEIF start clicking their heels)
JONATHAN & LEIF: 	There’s no place like BF Day! There’s no place like BF Day! Razors, Rainbows, and Rockers! Oh my! Razors, Rainbows, and Rockers! Oh my! SMOKE!
(JONATHAN & LEIF pick up a blanket while people hold pillows or something and then wake up from a dream maybe with other members of team as themselves.)
JACOB:	Hey guys, you’ve gotta wake up. It’s actually championship day, and beyond all logic and reason you have to both play games and taunt. (Checks watch.) Actually, you’ve already lost the game. But you still have to finish this taunt.
LEIF:	Oh wow, I just had the craziest dream and (points to JONATHAN) you were there and (points to JACOB’S abs one by one) you were there and you were there and you were there…
JONATHAN:	Wait, is this really our world? Jacob, who’s commissioner of the WKL?
JACOB:	Purkey!
(LEIF & JONATHAN shrug.)
LEIF:	Eh, good enough.
(Exit JACOB. Rest of the Block Rockers all rush in.)
FERGIE:		Hey, where’ve you guys been? It’s almost the end of the taunt!
JONATHAN:	Shit! How’re we gonna end this?
LEIF:	End with a song?
EVERYONE:	Yeah!

Wise men say
Only fools bunt in
But I can’t help
Falling in love with the WKL

Take my liver
Take my whole summer too
For I can’t help falling in love with you
(Reveal WKL = <3 Jell-O Shot sign)

(Three nerds sit at a table playing a nerd game stage right. When they play out the game it’s acted out by Divas on stage left. )

NERD MASTER: 	Well, excellent my intrepid warriors, you exit the arena after an awesome display of fierce action.  You round a corner and BAM you confront a pack of Dire-Paparazzi.  Roll for initiative?
NERD 1: 	I summon an entourage, a group of douche bags surround them to block us from their invasive gaze! (rolls dice)
NERD 2: 	I use my trusty iron heel and lash out at the nearest photographer smashing his camera! (rolls dice) YES!
NERD MASTER:	Your entourage only surrounds one reporter with a tape recorder but all the photographers are taking pics of the fight and MORE PHOTOGRAPHERS are headed THIS WAY! Quick Divas, escape to the waiting limousine!
NERD 1: 	Is there booze and druge in said limousine?
NERD MASTER: 	Of course!
NERD 1:	I want to party like it’s 1999
NERD MASTER:	Well, give me a roll! Roll a D20
NERD 1:	More like roll double deez nuts!
MAMA-DONNA:	 Boys! Boys I’m coming down the stairs now! I’ve got rice crispy treats and pootie tang!
NERD MASTER: 	mom, mom, MOMMA-DONNA!   We’re BUSY down here, JEEEZE!
MAMA-DONNA:	Boys, its fine, I don’t care what you’re doing down there, remember, I’m like a virgin too!  Now what are you guys playing down here? The Hearthstone, magic or Dungeons and Dragons?
NERD 2: 	Dungeons and Dragons? Pffhhhh… mom, what do you think this is 1975? No, we’re playing the new DND game Divas n Divas!
NERD MASTER:	Yeah Mom, it’s super cool, you wouldn’t understand it! You play the DIVAS from across all known time and space to do super cool stuff with babes n stuff!
NERD 2	Yeah, babes and stuff!
NERD 1:	Yeah, stuff. He, he, he. (nerd laughter ensues and gets real snorty and donkey like, think Revenge of the Nerds)
NERD MADONNA:	Well, can I play?
NERDS 1+2:	YEAH!
NERD MASTER:	Oh geeze. (rolls eyes)  Ok Pick a PH-Diva to play. 
NERD MADONNA:	OK, this one sucks, this one is dead, you already have a bard so there no reason to play this one.. oh I want to play Andy Whoreballs!
<Enter SAM>
NERD MADONNA:	oh yeah, he’s got high intelligence, super high sexual charisma, and a huge donger.  I’ll pick him.  But I want him to look different..
NERD 1:	Well you can change his appearance any way you want!
NERD MADONNA:	Ok, these pants are great, but I want shorter shorts (she rips off sams pants to reveal short shorts)  Awesome! Now how do we slay the dragon?
NERD MASTER:	Jeeeeeeze Mom! We don’t slay dragons, we soak up the limelight and use it’s power to become watered down versions of our predecessors.
NERD 1:	But KISS uses weapons, and so does Rammstein, she could totally have a sick ass sword!
NERD MASTER:	NO WAY!  Those bands use props, not real swords!
NERD 2:	But it’s make believe, she can do whatever she wants!
NERD MASTER:	NO WAY! 
NERDS 1+2: 	YES WAY!
NERD MASTER:	NERD FIGHT!
(Nerd fight ensues. Enter LEMMY from Motorhead)
LEMMY:	Break it up, break it up. Looks like we’ve found another case for Judge Gaga, the Diva’s judge, I’m your bailiff Lemmy from motorhead, and this is Gaga court.
(Enter JUDGE GAGA)
JUDGE GAGA:	Nerds. Dorks. Poindexters, goobers, and dweebs.  Today we hear the case about some dorks who have a problem. Let’s hear the case.
NERD MASTER:	Your honor, my mother wants to play DnD, and wants to play Andy Whoreballs with a giant sword-
NERD 1:	Well it doesn’t have to be –
GAGA:		Wait, wait, wait.  You’re nerds, right?  Like magic missiles and trek yourself? 
NERD MASTER:	Well, yeah.  But we’re totally different from those teams, cause… uh… cause we’re nerds.
GAGA: 		Silence goober- Seems like we’ve uncovered a more important case here.  SERIAL PLAGARISM!
NERD MASTER: 	No no, you see, we’re not the same as those teams because we do a poppy parody song in every taunt!  They only did parody songs, like once and a while.
GAGA:		Can you deny that you used a micro taunt formula that culminated in an AC/DC parody song for your championship taunt, USING	THE EXACT SONG FRENCH CONNECTION USED?
NERD 2: 	uh, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery?  
GAGA:		I SAID SILENCE. This case is far beyond the reach of myself, the peoples judge, I’ll have to pass this on to the Queen-
FREDDY MERCURY:  	Nope- too rich for my blood, this one has to go to God.
(Enter ALANIS MORISSETTE)
NERD MASTER:	Oh wow, god IS a woman
NERD 1:	And it’s Alanis Morissette, like in that Kevin smith movie, “Dogma.”
NERD 2:	Kevin Smith was right all along!
ALANIS: 	Nerds, Mama-dona. Allow me to teach you a lesson by using a song I adapted to suit this special situation
Ironic Lyrics:
An old idea turned ninety-eight
you worked it into a taunt, now isn’t it great
It's a pop fly in to your third base
It's a parody song, and a dance routine that’s safe
Weren't they iconic, don't you think
[Chorus—]
It's like rain on opening day
It's a lame joke you took from tv
It's the same old taunt
That’s been done all the time, but you win, so it figures
Mr. Kevin Tice was afraid to try
He packed his cooler and kissed his kids goodbye
He waited his whole damn life to taunt that night
And as the jokes crashed down he thought
"Well, at least my name is Tice."
And isn't it all ironic, don't you think


(SCENE OPENS: Fergie is standing on stage, alone.)
LEIF:		
FERGIE:	DIVAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSS! We regulate any stealing of our trophies / And we damn fabulous too / But you can't be any nerd from the 206, / Gotta be handy with stiletto heels if you know what I mean, to earn your keep! / Divas! mount up!
(DIVAS walk up to tent and knock on door. LEIF has fuzzy handcuffs on and a burlap sack on his head and is jerkin’ it into a sock.)
LEIF:		I’ll be right there!
(LEIF zips up pants and pulls burlap sack off and still has handcuffs on one wrist)
LEIF:		Hey guys, you’re early for taunt planning?
FERGIE:	No, we’re on time for torture.
LEIF:		Torture?
FERGIE:	Torture!
LEIF:		Uh, me?
FERGIE:	Yeah, you.
(SOMEONE grabs the burlap sack and puts it on LEIF’S head then shoves him back into his chair then takes it off again while FERGIE pulls out his phone and calls Dani. When the phone starts ringing, he walks around the front of the office showing her photo and name on his phone while it rings. One of the DIVAs is aggressively eating Nerds throughout the entire taunt.)
FERGIE:	DANI! Nerds better have my trophy! If you don’t hand over the taunt trophy right now we’re going to take your precious lover and commit a series of horrific acts.
DANI:		…….
FERGIE:	That’s right! NERD TORTURE!
LEIF:		No, not nerd torture! Wait, why should I care about that? I’m a diva, not a nerd!
DIVA 1:	But you’re a nerd by common law marriage!
LEIF:		You’re right! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THAT’S TERRIBLE
DIVA 2:	Leif, you’ve seen the trailer for The Last Jedi, right? Well, I just read the screenplay and Luke is Rey’s father… and mother!
LEIF:		NOOOOOOOOOO THAT’S IMPOSSIBLE
DIVA 11:	Spoiler alert (walks by with spoiler)
DIVA 2:	That’s right! It’s just like the hit 1994 Arnold Schwarzenegger film Junior!
LEIF:		No, that’s… rather implausible?
(DIVA 1 pulls out Star Wars action figure.)
FERGIE:	Diva 1 has an original 1977 Kenner Star Wars action toy… in the ORIGINAL BLISTER PACK.
LEIF:		Not original edition misprint Chewbacca with the blond hair!
FERGIE:	It’d be a shame if someone… opened it.
(DIVA 1 & 2 pull package and throws it into the audience.)
LEIF:		No! Think of the resale value!
EVERYONE:	Nerds better have my trophy trophy trophy trophy
(DIVAS 3 AND 4 pull out conspicuously giant feathers and start tickling Leif)
LEIF:		Guys. I said last night NO FUCKING TICKLING. Laughs uncontrollably hahaha no stop, hahaha don’t 
FERGIE:	Hear those screams, Dani? I’m fingerblasting his special places!
EVERYONE:		Nerds better have my trophy trophy trophy
(DIVAS 5 AND 6 step up with a laptop and a phone)
DIVA 5:		We just installed Windows Millennium Edition on your laptop! (shows off laptop screen to audience)
LEIF:			No, how could you? That’s where I keep my porn!
DIVA 6:		Well if you miss Windows 10 so bad… here’s a Windows phone! (throws him a phone)
LEIF:			No! My other porn!
EVERYONE:		Nerds better have my trophy trophy trophy
FERGIE:	What, Dani? You think this is a fucking JOKE? Let me show you the PUNCH line!

(MUSIC CUE: “Under the sea”)
EVERYONE:		Sex in the sea
			Sex in the sea
			Darling it’s better
			Down where it’s wetter
			You’ll take it from me!
			Up on the shore they jerk all day
			Out in the sun they ‘bate away
			While we devotin’
			Full time to bonin’
			Sex in the sea!
JACQUES COUSTEAU:	Hello, and welcome to this week’s episode of “Sex in the Sea!” Let’s dive right into the wettest depths this week and talk about the reproductive habits of the merfolk.
(ENTER TWO MERMEN AND A MERMAID)
COUSTEAU:	Mermaids take many sexual partners. So when a mermaid likes one or more mermen very much, which leads to foreplay…
(MERFOLK MAKEOUTS)
COUSTEAU:	And then, when she reaches the peak of her arousal, like any other fish the mermaid then drops her clutch of eggs.
(MERMAID drops a six pack of eggs on theground.)
COUSTEAU:	And then, the mermen, with their fish bottom halves, bring themselves to orgasm and inseminate the eggs, while the mermaid wanders off to find more partners.
MERMAN 1:	Hold on, we don’t even have dicks!
MERMAID:	Wait what? This sucks!
MERMAN 2:	No, wait! I swear I had one somewhere!
(EXIT MERFOLK)
COUSTEAU:	And now we move on to the most germ-ridden, scurviest, hiccup-having, bottom-feeders of the ocean… I speak of course, of the pirate. Here we see two pirates meeting on a moonlit night… on the poop deck.
(ENTER PIRATES – they both have beards – maybe one of the beards is a merkin. Or both.)
PIRATE 1:	Blackbeard, I’ve got to warn you – I’ve got the crabs down there.
PIRATE 2:	No worries, redbeard, I’ve got lobsters meself.
PIRATE 1:	Oof! You stink! How much rum have you had today?
PIRATE 2: 	I’ve been drinking just as much as something something sam ali’s boat. 
Pirate 1: 	We’re getting really lazy with these jokes!
Pirate 2: 	Yes we yarrr!
BUNCH O’ PIRATES:	YARRRRRRRR YARR YARR YARR
Pirate 1:	Ok, hold me hook I’m going in!
PIRATE 2:	No, peg me! And make sure you watch out for splinters!
PIRATE 1:	Oof, sorry, after all that rum today, I’m stuff at half-mast.
PIRATE 2: 	Come on, it’s like you’re pushing rope!
COUSTEAU:	Unfortunately, due to their excessive drinking behavior, pirate sex often just ends in frustration, sadness, and even more drinking.
(EXIT PIRATES)
COUSTEAU:	And now we move on to the octopus, the diva of the sea.
(ENTER URSULA and ANOTHER OCTOPUS)
COUSTEAU:	So as we can see here, the octopus has one tentacle longer than the rest, the “mating arm.”
URSULA:	Ooh, hey there, big fellow, I like the look of your semen wand!
COUSTEAU:	Because of its extraordinary size and prehensile flexibility, the octopus may have the most amazing sex in the entire animal kingdom!
OCTOPUS:	Let me gaze into your eyes… with my dick arm!
URSULA:	Why don’t you take that thing and shove it in my earhole to deposit your sperm! YES YES YES SCRAMBLE MY BRAINS WITH YOUR DICK ARM!
(COUSTEAU unveils anatomic diagram)
COUSTEAU:	No seriously, folks, that’s exactly how it works! He sticks that dick right in her ear and comes in it!		
OCTOPUS:	(orgasms, then leaves)
JACQUES COUSTEAU:	But sometimes, the female may have buyer’s remorse and remove the semen later.
(URSULA palms / removes sperm packet from her ear and throws it into the crowd)

DIVAs walk onto BF Day Playfield. On the Bleachers side of the fence, Ballshank Redemption (BSR) stands, chained together. DIVAs taunt BSR with a stick on the fence, mugs, rattling the fence, and warm up kicking kickballs against the fence at BSR. DIVAs say “Mean Taunty Things” 
Diva 1:  “…You know what they say, “Once you kill a cow you gotta make a burger.”

DIVA sings:
All day long they blow so hard
Yeah they’re all goin’ down
Trippin’ balls out on BF Day, wearing orange on the pitcher’s mound

Tice- Well Pledge, you’ve been in the league for 6 weeks, played 4 games, bunted only twice, and were able to harmonize on key for our witches taunt.  I think you’re ready to get jumped into the gang.
Newbie- Oh, no, I mean, I’m down for being part of a shitty razor scooter gang, you know like sons of anarchy without the Hamlet metaphors, good looking actors, and shittier writing, but I got keep my face pretty.  That’s hows I makes my money.

Dani- Like a pearl neckless?  A Columbian bow tie?
Leif- No, no no.  You need something else. (grabs a big jug labeled ACID) How about a FACIAL?!? (dumps the acid on her head.  Dani screams, puts her hands to her face and smashes a bunch of hamburger meat onto her face)

You lethargic Americans make me sick, with all your drama in the CCP, it’s kinda hard being Ivan Drunky. G Serfs! Up! Hoes/hose! Down! (While you motherfuckers bounce to this) Let’s get some motherfucking shots for this
[Serfs (with snorkles) pop out of hot tub, drop their hoes/hose, and carry ivan away on a surf board]
Bathwatch: [slowly running behind] HOOOOOOOLLLD DOOOOOOR
[snoop dog: gin and juice plays/ serfs bring out vodka shots]

Ministers of Jokes-  Velcome to beginning of kickball season, I am Berninstein Sandersvich, and I am proud to present ze first taunt of the season. Ve are bloc rocker pussy riot and for your entertainment, we have series of jokes approved by the Ministry of Humor.  These jokes and musical entertainings, are written for the people, not the one percent, the bankers, or the billionaire class.  The props are made through the collective works of peoples collectives, all of which have fabulous health care, maternity leaves and of course many potatoes for eating.  So please laugh loud or you will be shot.

Agata/Laika: Don't be fooled by the beets that I got
             I'm still, I'm still Agata from the bloc
             Used to have a little, now I have much less
             No matter where I go, I know where I came from

Background: From Poland!
(Agata hit old man bernienstein in the head with a beet.  He falls like sack of potatoes.  Much laughs.)
Baba yaga (wearing a sign saying “Baba Yaga, famous russian witch): Comrades it is I baba yaga, the famous Russian witch, get that bitch (Agata barks) off stage so we can focus on witches
1st pussy rioter-  I got this (gets huge comical micro phone) 
2nd pussy rioter - Move witch, get out the way, get out the witch get out the way.
Bernienstein :  I get knocked down, but I get up again! (gets knocked down again)
1RD Pussy rioter: 	You're a witch, you're a hiller,
Your favorite song is thriller,
You mix potions, you cast spells,
You'll probably go to hell.

You kick balls, you write taunts,
You've got some skills to flaunt,
You know we wouldn't play you any other way.
Uber Driver (can we steal a car from Luke’s taunt?)- Dig through the ditches and burn through the witches and cram in the back of my UBER ride-  
3rd pussy rioter - Hey this uber can fit 7 people?
Uber Driver: It is prius?!?
3nd Pussy Rioter:  Yeah, so 7 people is totes cool, am I right?
Uber Driver: So where do you want to go?

All pussy rioters sit in a line in front of the 3rd pussy rioter 
3th pussy rioter:  	I wanna be where the witches are
I wanna see, wanna see 'em bunting
Stumblin’ around in those
Whaddya call 'em? Oh, cleats

Stirring your legs (a la calling all the basic witches), you dn't get too far
Ankles are required for runnin’, kickin’
Conga linin’ along down the
What's that word again? Baaaaar
	Up where they drink, up where they chug
Up where they  party having fun
Wish I could be, no
Witch I could be, drunk WKL
All leg swingin’ pussy riotiers in a monotone chant :  Calling all the basic witches.  Call all the basic witches.  You’re basic.  
4th Pussy rioter: Guys what the hell is going on, this taunt is all over the place. Maybe we shouldn’t have taken all of that acid.
5th Pussy rioter: But how else would we have neutralized all of those basic witches.
Baba Yaga: 	If you’re having taunt problems I feel bad for you hun, 
I got 99 problems but a witch ain’t one! HUG ME! <mic drop> 

Ferg: Well Hello WKL,  welcome to the second week of the Season. Now when I heard that Capown’d had decided to do a Game of thrones team not only because, I’m a huge fan of the series, and finally we have a team idea from these guys that isn’t racist.  But I’m here today to express my disappointment in you guys once again.  You guys fucked it up.  You really, really fucked it up.  Anthony, Alexandra,  Jason, come on up here.   Now first off, you fucked up your name, a taunt of thrones??? What the fuck were you thinking?  The WAY better name for your team is:  A game of taunts, a song of balls and fire.  For fucks sakes.  You’re killing me here (SPOLIER ALERT) Now, let’s just look on how you royally buggered the casting of your team.  Anthony, you play Geoffery, the little shit of a king of Westeros.  Now in the series, Geoffery, marries Magery Tyrel, a woman older than him, and you wouldn’t even finger bang a woman ½ your age yet a lone marry them.  Alexdanra, you play Danerys storm born, the mother of dragon.  You guys almost got this one, but Alexandra is the mother of a number of herpes which also burn, but are far less deadly.  And last but not least on the numerous ways you have fucked up your kickball season we have Jason.  Jason, you are Vayrs, the master of spies and, notably, an effeminate eunuch.      Now, you may be a little light in the loafers, but from what I;ve heard from the guys who work at The white Swallow, steam works, or any of Seattle’s many “gentlemen’s bath houses” this guys scrotum, and rectum, hang to his knees.   Ok, ok, Now instead of taunting you, which I think would be a waste of time, because you’ve already fucked this up so much-  We’re going  to play MUSICAL THRONES-  a game where you win, or you get wasted.  Ok, you’re going to get wasted anyway.

(Basically we make them walk around a series of thrones,, until the music stops, then they sit on a throne, but each throne has a consequence.)
 The throne of the French (a throne covered in baguettes) – the person who chooses this throne has to do the croissant shot.  The joke is that when we bring them the croissant shot, there are actually 13 shots, a bakers.
The Throne of the North – A toilet filled with ice, that the person has to sit in and drink a pint of peppermint schnapps  before they can stand up.  Someone sits on them saying HORDOR until they finish the bottle
The Thrones of Dildos- Sit, uncomfortably or maybe VERY comfortably in the Throne of dildos, taking a few blow job shots to the face.
The Iron Throne- You ,must beer bong wine until your team members can name (either the 7 kingdoms of Westoros or 7 Iron and Wine song titles)   


(SCENE: FERGUSON holding a triform. FLOWER PEOPLE walk up and grab the sides.)
FLOWER PEOPLE (SINGING): Little shop! Little shop of horrors!
(FLOWER PEOPLE unfold triform, revealing vagina with Andy’s face.)
FERGUSON: Feed me semen! Feed me!
 (Record scratch. COLLEEN runs on stage, grabs the triform and throws it away.)
COLLEEN: No no guys, I’m sorry but this won’t work. Booze Scouts already did this lame idea. I’ve got an idea for a way better musical.
(Backdrop unveils: “THE SOUND OF WHORROR”)
COLLEEN: The whores are alive with the sound of cumming

WOMEN: (Women moan) The job they have done for a thousand years, The cock fills my cunt with the sound of cumming

MEN: (Men moan) My mouth wants to blow every cock it nears

(Enter NAPOLEON.)

NAPOLEON: Your socks are too short, you silly Austrian person!

(NAPOLEON cuts off COLLEEN’S HEAD)

EVERYONE: Quelle horreur, quelle horreur!

(Exit NAPOLEON and COLLEEN, enter AGATA, THING 1, and THING 2)

AGATA: Comedrops on titties and whiskers on pussies
Tight moistened sphincters on warm virgin tushies
Discrete paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

When the slave bites
Then the whip stings
When I’m feeling bad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don’t feel so sad

(Enter NAPOLEON)

NAPOLEON: Your Ed Hardy tattoos are not douchey enough!

(NAPOLEON CUTS OFF AGATA’S HEAD)

(Exit NAPOLEON and AGATA. Enter JEFF, JONATHAN, and THE ANALWEISS CHORUS)

(JEFF BENDS OVER WITH JONATHAN BEHIND HIM WHILE HE STARTS SINGING)

JEFF: Analweiss, analweiss

(JONATHAN STARTS FUCKING JEFF UP THE ASS)

JEFF (switches to falsetto, at least for a bit): Every morning you greet me
Big and black
Thick and stacked
You look happy to meet me
My rubber bro may you bloom and grow
Bloom and grow forever
Analweiss Analweiss
Bless my backdoor forever

(Enter NAPOLEON)

 NAPOLEON: Fuck fuck fuck Cute Cute Cute!

(Massacre ensues.)

(Exeunt NAPOLEON and THE ANALWEISS CHORUS.)

(Enter LEIF and CHRISTINE. LEIF sits down on a stage while CHRISTINE gives him a lap dance.)

LEIF: YOU ARE SIXTEEN GOING ON SEVENTEEN
BABY IT’S TIME  TO THINK
BETTER BEWARE, BE CANNY AND CAREFUL
BABY YOU’RE ON THE BRINK

(Enter NAPOLEON.)

NAPOLEON: Too soon! We’re not taunting Monaco until Thursday!

(NAPOLEON kills LEIF and CHRISTINE.)

(ENTER EVERYONE. CURTAIN CALL WITH REPRISE.)

EVERYONE: The whores are alive with The French Connexxxion!

(Ends with someone crossing the stage with a sign that says “APPLAUSE”.)

(BEAVER TRADER #1 & #2 enter scene. One of them is holding a map.)
BEAVER TRADER #1: At last, we have arrived on scenic Punani Wu! On this map, it says “HERE THERE BE BEAVERS.” Which, as French beaver traders, is exactly what we need! But it’s written in English! Which as French beaver traders, is very confusing!
BEAVER TRADER #2: Zees island is supposed to be covered in beaver! I have heard that the beaver runs so thick that the ground is like one giant 1970’s bush!
TRADER #1: Yes, and then we can take all zee island beaver back to France and sell it on the street at outrageous prices!
TRADERS: (French laughter, you know, “hon hon hon hon hon”) 
(The two look around the island)
 (Enter LUKE, clapping two coconuts, enter luke wearing a Hawaiian shirt and no pants.  Hot dog wang a flyin’)
LUKE: Hello there!
TRADER #1: Zut alors! An indigenous person!
TRADER #2: We must subjugate him at once!
(Move to attack him)
LUKE: No wait! Like you colonialist explorers, I too am white and have a penchant for exploiting island cultures! I am LUKE WALKER, captain of TEAM ZISSOU!
TRADER #2: Oh I’m sorry! Your stereotypical pan-Pacific-Islander style of dress is as convincing as it is culturally insensitive! Mais oui, we are beaver traders who have come to harvest your island’s finest beaver!
LUKE: Oh, sorry there’s no beaver here, there’s only one jack ass.  Get it?  I mean me!  But seriously, do you have any food?  There’s no food on this island.
TRADER #1: But, uh, zee map it says there would be beavers here.
LUKE: Yeah, all the Beavers died after we got here.  You see that Volcano over there, the one that looks like a snatch?  Yeah, it erupts once a month, for like 3 to 5 days.  You can always tell when it’s coming because the island gets all bitchy.  GET IT?  LIKE A WOMANS VAGINA WHEN IT MENSTRUATES. HAY-OOOOOOOH!  I am so funny and clever.
TRADER #2: Zaat is how you say, predictable.  We do not find your antics amusing, and that is saying a lot, we find Jerry Lewis funny. 
LUKE: Yeah whatever, I don’t care about you, this is all about ME ME ME.   You see, I was on a Life Aquatic cruise when we ran aground here and got stranded.
TRADER #1: Yes, I think I read about that in the papers. “The Zissou Accident,” they called it. The headline in Le Monde read “Drunk Assholes Lost at Sea” for a week!
(Spinning newspaper headlines spin across stage:
#1: DRUNK ASSHOLES LOST AT SEA
#2: WARRANT SERVED FOR INTOXICATED CRUISE CAPTAIN
#3: U.S. COAST GUARD ABANDONS SEARCH FOR LOST SUBMARINE, CLAIMING “NOBODY GIVES A SHIT REALLY” 
TRADER #2: But Zissou was two years ago! What have you been doing the whole last year?
LUKE: Mostly masturbating to my taunt ideas. I mean… pornography. Masturbating to ADULT pornography.
TRADER #1: What happened to the rest of your crew? Did they drown?
LUKE: No, we couldn’t find any food here so we had to eat all the men one by one.
TRADER #2: So you had to eat your entire crew? Quelle horreur… quelle horreur!
LUKE: No, there were only a couple guys on the team, but after we ate the last one all the girls built a raft and left for Wang Island. They said something about my creepy mustache giving them eye herpes, but that doesn’t make any sense because this thing is AWESOME! You see, it curls up, and then it curls up a second time on each side, which I feel is superior to a normal moustache, and it does it all without any need for mustache wax whatsoever, which is a total chick magnet—

TRADER #2: <vomits>
TRADER #1: So have you been trapped here alone this whole time?
LUKE: No, I’ve had Wilson here to keep me company. But he got a bit… deflated after a while.
(Luke pulls out deflated kickball with eyes, a nose, and a small circle for a mouth drawn on it with a sharpie ala that other Tom Hanks movie I haven’t seen. Inside the mouth is a tiny hole due to puncturing by a tiny penis. Semen is dripping out the hole.)
TRADER #2: So you sodomized a kickball and ate human beings.
LUKE: No, after I popped off Wilson, I just started building HUGE props and costumes for my epic return to taunting.   I also came up with an elaborate team theme that NO ONE WILL UNDERSTAND!  Here, I’ve made flyers for everyone detailing every aspect of my amazing totally creative idea!  (hands out a few really long scrolls) 
TRADER #1: What first this is really racist against Polynesians, also isn’t your idea just a ripoff of a movie where Tom Hanks has a shitty mullet that lost almost 10 million Euros, it was a bigger flop zen Howard zee duck.
 
(TRADER #1 pulls off glove, slaps LUKE in face with it)
TRADER #2: The French have appropriate punishment for cannibalism, kickball-intercourse, and crimes against facial hair… Madame Guillotine!
TRADER #1: Mes amis! Grab him!
(Other FRENCH CONNEXXXION players enter and restrain LUKE. One of them has a tiny guillotine. Or maybe a cigar cutter, which is apparently also called a guillotine.)
LUKE: No, what are you doing? You can’t cut that off! I use that all the time, I swear! I have sex with lots and lots of women!
(FRENCH TRADERS first cut off the ends of the mustache with the guillotine, making it into a Hitler mustache. FRENCH TRADERS then cut the wang in half with the guillotine. Then throw it into the audience. LUKE turns around and somehow squirts wine out of the crotch wound into the audience then runs away. One of the TRADERS captures the wine in a goblet and ceremoniously drinks it.)
TRADER #2: I am glad we have gotten rid of that silly American fool before we had to taunt him a second time. Let us explore this island further so we do not waste this trip.
(FRENCH CONNEXXXION players wander around, and one of them peers under the tarp)
TRADER #1: I do not know why he said there was no food on this island. I mean, there’s coconut trees all over the place, and guava, and papaya, and—
(FRENCH CONNEXXXION players tear down tarp revealing FOOD TRUCK)
PLAYER #3: --hey guys, there’s a food truck over here! Run by Julia Child!
JULIA CHILD: Hellooooooo! Welcome to How Pickle Got Into a Clam! We’ve been here for like a year but we only just got the generator running! Would you like to try our unicorn crepes?

	
 (SCENE OPENS: We find our selves in the back stage of the WKL half time show, ball shankers are placing huge props in positions, the spirit of 70 kicks kids are directing the action. There are Dressing rooms stage right, the back of the theater center, and craft services etc stage left.  There is a whirl wind of action going on.  Cases being moved stage left and stage right, large props being put into place etc.)
Tricia (stage manager) : All right you ball shankers, I don’t want any trouble out of you today or else your going RIGHT back to jail.   No! NO! NO!  Penis mountain goes stage left and the Pussy bridge to the heavenly clit goes stage RIGHT!  Strike ONE ball shank! Can’t believe they gave us prison labor as stage hands, what cheap bastard is paying for this shit show?  All right everyone, come together. We’re 5 mins away from being LIVE on tv for the WKL half time show.  I want you all to be professional, happy, and perfect.  I expect nothing less.  Danny-
Danny: Yes tricia?
Tricia: My head set please. (danny hands her his head set, maybe we bedazzle this bitch?) PLACES PEOPLE, LET’S DO THIS PEOPLE. 
Enter Andy WHoreballs with a gaggle of Divas, Andy is taking pictures of the Divas
Andy: Oh, fabulist, beautiful, make nonconsensual sex to my lens.
Tricia: Mr. Whoreballs, I believe we are ready for you.
Andy: No, no no.  This is all wrong.
Madonna: Yeah, where is my didldo unicorn?
Tricia: uh, we never spoke about a dildo-
Lemmy: Where is my skull that shoots snakes out of the eyes?
Tricia: Skull that?
Andy: yeah, and where is my Lady GaGa?  What the Hell Tricia?  I hired you because you are the most competent person in the whole freaking league, and you screw all this up?
Tricia: Mr. Whoreballs, I swear we never spoke about any of this
Andy: Of course we didn’t.  We stayed up until 3am last night writing this magum opus, instead of the garage we were going to do. Here’s the new taunt. (hands tricia a stack of papers) 
Lady GaGa: (now at the craft services table) Uh, Andy.  We have a huge problem.
Andy:  What is it my muse?
Lady: I FOUND A GODAMN GREEN M&M IN THE NO GREEN M&M BOWL
(All the diva’s freak out and go to their dressing room, during this move lady gag a gets connected to the hoist and lifted in the air)
Andy: well shit Tricia.  You better figure this out.  I’m going to use this time to get all my awkward minutes in.  (starts filming the taunt)
Tricia: Ok, christ.  Look at this thing.  (looking at the taunt) Ok, baby Kyle, SOME OTHE MEMBER OF BALL SHANK, come here. We’re going to hve to completely remake everything we’ve done for this-
Baby Kyle: Ah shit.  I hate taunts.  
Other PMS member: we have to do it baby kyle.  Do you want to go back in the hole?
Baby Kyle: I want to get back in your-
Tricia: NO!  Just get back to work. Danny, Rob, I need you two to go out there and entertain the crowd for like 5 minutes.  We need to buy time
Danny: Sure thing T money.  How about we sing a song, like fuck the French all  night?
Tricia: No, no more old throw back jokes.  Do something from this year
Danny: yeah, but nothing we did this year was close to as good as fuck the French-
Tricia: I DON’T CARE.  Just get your skinny ass out there and enterain those drunks.
Bobby: I’m here too-
Tricia: WHATEVER. Just get out there and kills some time.
(enter the nerd herd)
Kevin: Tricia! Tricia, we have the solution to all your problems.  Lasers!
Tina: Lasers? Guys, this is a day time show, there’s no way the WKL is going to see lasers in day light.
Danni: Don’t worry, I’ve got an expert here, one that you might be questionably attracted too. (the lasers gag starts)
Isaac: You see, we use ultra violet light that passes through a quartz crystal-
Tina: Yeah, I know how lasers-
Isaac: Shh.  I’m mansplaining-
Tina: Sploosh.   Come with me.
Dylan and another pirate enter
Dylan: Hey Tricia, put us on, we got a great bit, check it out.  What has 8 legs, 8 arms and eight eyes?
Pirate 2: I don’t know Dye-lon?
Dylan: 8 pirates!  Waka waka waka
(hook grabs them and pull them off)
Tricia: Christ (checks watch) 4 minutes until we’re live
Danny (sticks head out of the curtain, possibly covered in blood) Tricia, We’re getting killed up here.  We need some help.
Andy Whoreballs:  Trica, darling, I need to speak to Ga Ga about the third act.  Have you seen her?
Ga ga: I’m up here.  Help.  I’m stuck
Tricia: No I haven’t seen her.  


(SCENE OPENS: Tina walks into the scene where Tricia, Danny, Danielle and Emily are standing next to the score board, our current team placards are up.  Danny is using a guitar as a crutch, Danielle has a boot on..  Our current teams are on the score board. )
Tina:  	Hey 76’ers!  How many of us are going to actually play against D.I.V.A today?
Danny:	Oh man, It’s just Trisha and 6 “ringers” out there.  We don’t even have a full team. We’re going to get slaughtered. 
Daniel: Yeah, wish we could play, I mean, Danny got hit by a car last weekend, so he’s obviously out.  And me, my leg gets mysteriously injured for 10 weeks every year right around kickball, so I’ve been out this entire season, again.  Bummer.
Emily- It’s really weird how it happens every season.  Hey, I got champers! 
Danielle:(jumps up runs over to her) Ooo!  I want some!
Emily- Like I said, really weird.  (pours some champers)
Tricia: Damnit you guys, I’m going to be out there for EVERY INNING, and I’m a freaking mom! Emily why aren’t you playing?
Emily: Taking care of the wounded. D’uh
Tina: What are we doing for the taunt?
Danny: Well, we’re going to sing a super awesome song.  Ah one two three (sings) D. I. V. A. it fun to play against D IVA-
Tricia: Ug, I’m OVER IT.  We’re doing a song for the taunt?  REALLY? We’re going there AGAIN? No story? No Set-up? No costumes? Aren’t we more creative than that?  What does it mean to be the SPIRIT of seventy kicks? 
Enter the spirit of 76’s
Spirit of 76: Behold, it’s I, the spirit of 70 kicks.  
Tricia, Dany, Danielle, Emily, Tricia: Wilkers!
Spirit of 76:  I’ve come here today to teach you of the true spirit of the WKL!
Tricia: Whiskey?
Spirit of 76: No no no, the other one.  I am going to take you to your past team, your present team, and YOUR TEAM OF THE FUTRE.  I’ll show you where you lost your spirit!
Danny: Wait, is this a Christmas carol taunt?  Didn’t you guys try to do a Christmas taunt last week?
Spirit of 76: did we really try?  
Danny: fair point.  Well, let’s get this over with, just take me, I’ll tell them the story when I get back. I tell the best stories. (does the Wayne’s world doodly doos)
Spirit of 76: No, bad Danny! We’re not doing that, it’s lame. I summon the ghost of WKL PAST!! ({SMOKE} takes off one table cloth to reveal a black/pirate themed table cloth.  Score board changes to Pirates vs Monster squad All the other 76’s change quickly into pirate costumes, drinking and having a good time)
Danny: When are we
Spirit of 76: We’re back  in 2009!
Danny: Oh wow, the last year we were the pirates.  Look, we were having so much fun!  
Spirit of 76: Yes, yes you were!  You all were the life of the party!  Dancing on the bar at the buckaroo, getting shit faced every single night, wearing the same godaman costumes you had worn for the last 7 years.
Danny: Look at Emily, she was only 17 but we got her in that bar every night.  
Spirit: For reals?  Look  with your whole eyeballs Danny, what else do you see?  
Danny: I see the rest of the WKL is here too!  Look, Luke’s in his teen wolf costume.  Fergy here and he weighs 50lbs less!  Holy shit, there’s the freaking NUDGEE!
Spirit: Are you starting to get what made your team so spirited?
Danny: Not. at. all.
Spirit: Then we must go to the present. (pulls off the pirate table cloth to reveal the American table cloth)
Dany: No no no.  We’ve already done the present and it sucks.  this taunt is already long so let’s just skip to the end.
Spirit: FINE! To the future we go. (pulls off the American table cloth to reveal the final one, team names are now Split pee and Hambone: A soup themed team, and Soft Taco Penis quiet {maybe make this better} sprit of 76 kick are now super old)
Dany Wowzers, look at all the flying cars! 
Spirit; We still call those airplanes Danny.  It’s only 2030.  Look, there’s you team.
Danny: Holy shit.  We’ve aged TERRIBLY. 
Spirit: Yes, all the drinking, and being in the sun by the score board has turned your already aged bodies in to old leathery skin bags.
Tina: Tricia, sure is nice that Hamish joined our team.
Tricia: Yeah, ever since the accident turned him into a mutant cyborg, he just the best kickball player.
Tina; I know! He can play all the positions at once with his crazy cyborg speed, so we have to do is here by the score board all game long.
Danielle: Let’s be honest, it’s the only thing we’ve enjoyed for years.  Look over at the bleachers, bunch a new kids, having fun, chanting, tking off their clothes, GET OFF MY LAWN….  We’re far too old and lame for the.  Yup.  Score board is where it’s at.
Danny: Wait, wait! Spirit!  I’ve figured it out! I KNOW WHAT WE’VE DONE TO LOSE OUR SPIRIT!  Take me back!  Take me back to our time.
Spirit: I can’t, I already threw away the now time table cloth-
Danny: Fine, I’ll just do it myself(does the waynes world doodbly doos,  score board changes to current day, team changes to current day, 76sers turn into today)  Guys! I know how we’ve lost our spirit. We all just hang out here in front of the score board during every game, blocking the view for everyone! The entire rest of the league is hanging out there, bleachering, meeting new people! We don’t hang out with anyone new, hell we even turn down rookies before the season starts, and now we can’t even field a team now! If we mix it up, and get out there and meet the league, they’ll all remember how awesome we are!  Guys we don’t need crutches or air casts, we need our booze, drugs and fun.  So let’s abandon this score board forever and stick our spirit right back into the WKL.  Who is with me?
all 76ers:  (bunch of cheers)
Danny: DICKS OUT KIDS!

 (SCENE OPENS: Bunch of Dino’s sitting around a Christmas tree. Jasmin passes Scottie a large present.)
JASMIN:	And this big package is for Scottie!
SCOTTIE:	I’ve always wanted a big package! Is it from Mama?
JASMIN:	No, not the mama. It must be a secret admirer.
EVERYONE:	Ooooooooooooooooohhhh!!!!!
(SCOTTIE opens up the present to reveal a giant egg.)
SCOTTIE:	It’s… a giant egg.
STICKNEY:	Is it Faberge?
SCOTTIE:	Noooooooo.
AFTON:	Is it an everlasting cock sucker from Bling it Onka’s Taunt Factory?
SCOTTIE:	Noooooooooo!
(Egg cracks open revealing baby Diva the Dinosaur [Hamish’s hand puppet dinosaur].)
SOUND CUE:	Cracking sound.
AFTON:	Ooooh, a baby Dinosaur, it’s so cute. Let’s name her Dee-Dee!
(Afton plays with Diva, who bites off her finger. She screams and blood squirts everywhere, D.I.V.A.s enter to sing.

CHORUS: 	Dee-Dee, the last dinosaur
		She’s my friend and a whole lot more.
		Dee-Dee, the last dinosaur
		She ate my finger and now I’m sore.

(Sign saying “time passes”. Diva and Scottie enter stage. Diva is older now [actually a larger dog in one of Hamish’s dinosaur costumes])
SCOTTIE:	(Looking around to make sure the coast is clear). Hey Dee Dee, do you want some peanut butter? 
(Scottie pulls out hot dog dick from pants as if he is going to smear peanut butter on it to have Diva fellate him. Diva immediate eats hot dog [as dogs will]. Scottie screams and blood squirts everywhere.)

CHORUS:	DEE-DEE the last Dinosaur, 
		she’ll eat your dick and a whole lot more.
(Sign saying “time passes” Dino’s are on stage and adult Diva enters [one of us in the dinosaur onesie]. She is eating some bloody meat or something).

DIVA:		Hey gang, you wanted to see me?
AFTON:	Yeah, we need to talk. Please, sit down.
DIVA:		What’s this about? Is this a fucking intervention? 
JASMIN:	Dee-Dee, your primordial urges are seriously becoming a problem. You need to be a more evolved being.
DIVA:		But this is who I am! 
STICKNEY:	You have to be better than your basic instincts.
 
SCOTTIE:	You’ve been hanging around with a real Paleo-pathetic crowd. And this dino culture that you’re promoting is causing real dino damage. Not just to us, your family, but for the entire community.
MAMA:	We need you to be the kind of dinosaur who if you see something, you say something. Not the dinosaur who does something. If you do something, we want you to say something, before we see something. You see what I’m saying?
SCOTTIE:	And if you see something on the field, and you record it, you should upload it right away. Like before you leave the field, it’s super easy, there’s no reason not to.
DIVA:		So wait. If I see something, I should say something, and then do something? I’m confused.
MAMA:	Dee-Dee, we just want what’s best for you.
DIVA:		I think I know what the root cause of my problem is. You see with these tiny arms I can’t pleasure myself, so I take it out on my friends. And strangers. And puppies. And puppy strangers. And I’d really like to take it out on this one crazy neighbor…
AFTON:	No Diva, this isn’t how we raised you. Which is why we are sending you away for human conversion therapy.
DIVA:		But I’m not a human, I’m a dinosaur, I was born this way.
CHORUS: 	I was boooorn this way! (Lady Gaga style)
SCOTTIE:	No, there is a human at your dinocore. Just look in a mirror!
JASMIN:	Mirror!? We doing lines?
CHORUS:	White Lines! (Grandmaster Flash style)
STICKNEY:	It’s a metaphor, Jasmin. 
(Diva goes crazy, killing all the dinos, lots of blood and body parts).
DIVA:		You don’t gnome me. (slaps gnome hat off someone)
		I don’t want to go to rehab. 
CHORUS:	Nooo, Nooo, No (Amy Whinehouse Style)
DIVA:		This is who I am! This is how I express myself!
CHORUS:	Express yourself! (Madonna style)
DIVA:		I’m changing my look, I’m changing my name 
and I’m hittin’ the road jack. 
CHORUS:	Hit the road jack. (Paul Simon Style. Gets cut off by Diva.)
DIVA:			I AM a more evolved dinosaur, I’m a diva-saur!
		From now on, call me DIVA.
 (While Diva is still ripping people apart a bunch of D.I.V.A.’s sing the song)
CHORUS: 		diva, the first diva-saur, 
			she's evolved into a whole lot more, 
			diva the first diva-saur,
			she's a little glam, and a whole lotta gore!

SONG CUE:	Born this way. 
(Diva and D.I.V.As dance around the dead dinos.)
(END)

(Open to see large phone and Durst. Most of taunt is just Durst hanging out at home, walking around doing chores, etc. while responding to messages that come up on the phone. )


Durst: hmm… Someone’s messaging me. Looks like the team. I’ll just post this little emoji of myself. Taunt planning? I'm out!
[Leaves group, gets added back in]
What? I thought I left the group chat. Oh, thanks a LOT Miles. Whatever…I guess I could maybe go have a drink… Wonder what time they’re getting together. Oh, 7, that’s like right now.
I wonder who we’re taunting… Is it the Divas? The Divas… are… poop. I'm out.
[Leaves group, gets added back in]
Ashley, do you really think we can do a song and dance routine against the Divas?
Really Kevin? A fight scene? That’s exactly what we did against them last year. 
The divas are attacked by queen bees and ant queens in the forest? Spencer you’re so weird. Sounds like a Dino-Core taunt.
Facial? YEAH Ashley, that’s hilarious. Divas LOVE getting facials.
Fisting? No, that's just gross.
Gangsta rap Kevin? We just did that on Saturday.
Marry, Boff, Kill. Oh Spencer, when will you learn?
What is this some kind of Game of Thrones idea, Spencer? That's been done to death. Don’t they know there was a whole team dedicated to that a few years ago? I mean bringing that back would just be taunt suicide. 
Oh man looks like everyone is getting a little too dramatic for me. “Seriously guys, I told you, I’m not in the League anymore.”
[Leaves group, gets added back in]
Dang, Spencer is getting pissed. He must be upset that no one likes his ideas. Yeah spencer, smoke some trees, chill out dude. Screw this
[Leaves group, gets added back in]
GRRRRRR!!!
[Leaves group, gets added back in]
Miiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiles
[KNOCK AT THE DOOR]
SPENCER: What the HELL MAN?!! You don’t like any of my ideas, nobody likes any of my ideas, I just feel like I’m not a functional part of this team… 
[Spencer tried to hurt Durst. Christine comes in to interrupt]
CHRISTINE: “Emojis may be fun, but they don’t convey the true depth of feeling available in the English language. There’s too much misunderstanding in today’s society, we need to come together in the same room 
Someone in crowd: (THAT’S WHAT SHE SAID!)
CHRISTINE: – hey! - in actual real rooms using actual goddamned words. Otherwise, people’s feelings get hurt. Seriously, emojis are a problem harming innocent people all over the world today. Remember, use your words, kids. Use your goddamned words.”

GNOMES:	Two gnomes enter! No gnomes leave! Two gnomes enter! No gnomes leave!

HEATHER AND LUKE:	Gnooooooooooome, we lost our army of gnomes! 
GAGA:		No, there’s a better way! With fewer puns, and shorter taunts! Well, maybe shorter taunts? Not necessarily this one! And awesome song and dance routines!
(HEATHER and LUKE start dancing with everyone else.)
LUKE:		You’re right! Singing and dancing is way more fun than just doing shitty puns. As thanks, I give you the greatest weapon in the gnome world… THE ROSETTA’S GNOME!
LUKE hands LEMMY the scroll. Lemmy unrolls it.
LEMMY:	Uh, this is, just a bunch of gnome puns and the last one is I like the way you work it?

Person 7 con’t: I’ve never been in a taunt before, we didn’t really get a lot of time to practice and I don’t really understand what’s going on. However, I’m going to deliver these lines the best I can and the people who watch it online at work tomorrow will not be able to hear what I’m saying.  My lines are extremely integral to the taunt and much too wordy for anyone to follow. 

Person 2: This is the part where we set-up what is about to happen.  penis.

After all this time floating alone in space the crew is getting understandably antsy. With this mission coming to a close I too am ready for some shore leave and a little R&R.
TREKKIE 1:	Captain, we are approaching starbase Deep Throat Nine. I’m making the Final Penetration now.

TREKKIE 1:	We’ve docked, captain.
CAPTAIN:	Bridge to the transporter room, 3 to beam down to the station.

(ENTER PREDATOR)
ALISSA:	Oh, he’s mine.
PREDATOR:	You know, I’m not sure if she’ll be able to handle my 4 foot long barbed corkscrew cock.

CAPTAIN:	No, this isn’t right, we’ve been sent here by the Federation to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new fucks and new inebriations. To cum where no man, or woman, has ever cum before. We are the crew of the U.S.S. In-Her-Thighs and we WILL live up to our founding principles. Now give me some of that sweet space juice!

WIL:		Hi, I’m TV’s Wil Wheaton, you might know me as Wesley Crusher from Star Trek: The Next Generation, or from my performance as Wil Wheaton on The Big Bang Theory. Now speaking of big banging, today I want to talk to you about a serious problem plaguing the galaxy: space herpes.
TREKKIES (in background):	OH GOD I’VE GOT SPACE HERPES! (proceed to freak the fuck out and run around quietly screaming)
WIL:		Like many of you in the audience, I too have acquired space herpes after an intimate encounter with a sextra-terrestrial. I try to be careful, but outbreaks can occur at any time.
CAPTAIN (in background):	MY PENIS JUST FELL OFF!
WIL:		That’s why I take the only medicine proven to reduce the risk of spreading space herpes. (HOLDS UP CUP) Val-Trek. Taken once daily, or four times each on Wednesdays and Thursdays, it can help protect my partner… and maybe keep my penis from falling off.
CAPTAIN and TREKKIE tackle WIL and start doing shots of Val-Trek.

PERSON 4: 	Yeah, I agree! I’m finally going to live my dream and be an ice skating ribbon dancer!
PERSON 5:	I’m going to be a spiritual healer, massage therapist who teaches yoga!
PERSON 6: 	I’m going to heal the world with hugs!
HEIDI:		Oh that’s so beautiful! Start with me!
(person 6 hugs Heidi)
PERSON 6: 	(Staring deeply into Heidi’s eyes) You’re so amaaaaazing! You’re so beautiful!
HEIDI:			I feel beautiful! You’re amazing! OH MY GOD everyone, let’s all hug!
PERSON 3: 		(HUGGING PERSON 2) You’re my best friend!
PERSON 2: 		and you’re mine!
PERSON 6: 		You guys, I think we need a BIG group hug to help save the world!
PERSON 4: 		Yeah, let’s do it! Stand up everyone, we’re here to save you!
(everyone lines up next to each other and walks toward the audience to give a big group hug. Cookies and jello shots are given out)

(ENTER NUMBER ONE. They walk back and forth and do exposition.)
CAPTAIN:	Number One, you’re running late. Were you at a slumber party?
NUMBER ONE:	I was under the impression it was casual Friday. 
(CAPTAIN and NUMBER ONE both look at Fergie. Pregnant pause.) 
FERGIE:	What?
NUMBER ON:	But seriously, I was dealing with number two…
CAPTAIN:	Lieutenant Commander Data?
NUMBER ONE:	Data, sir?
CAPTAIN:	Yes, you see if you and I were incapacitated he would be in command of the ship.
NUMBER ONE:	Oh, not that number two.
CAPTAIN:	Ah, clever number one!  You were referring to feces. If I remember my 21st century history classes correctly, that sort of vocabulary may come in quite handy in our next mission. 
NUMBER ONE:	Sir?
CAPTAIN:	You see we’ve been tasked by Starfleet Command on a mission into human history critical to preserving the existence of the Federation itself.
NUMBER ONE:	But doesn’t time travel violate the Prime Directive, sir? And what does this have to do with doodoo?
CAPTAIN:	Section 31 has suspended the prime directive and all Starfleet regulations for this mission, so anything goes! WOOOOOOOOO! 
(THEY HIGH FIVE)
NUMBER ONE:	Does that include don’t ask, don’t tell?
(CAPTAIN and NUMBER ONE stare at each other awkwardly. Pregnant pause.) 
CAPTAIN:	The important part is that we must travel back in time to the summer of 2015 on a mission that could, I repeat, alter the very course of human history.
NUMBER ONE:	2015?!? That’s just one year before… the incident! Are we leaping back in time so that we can strive to put right what once went wrong?!
CAPTAIN:	No, no, no. We’re just going on a beer run. Rear Admiral B’ahymen just finished off the last case of Rainier, and since the Free Cascadian Beer Wars the replicators can only make triple-hopped black IPA. But before we go back in time, we must familiarize ourselves with the culture of the era.
NUMBER ONE:	Oh, hence--
CAPTAIN:	Yes, they referred to their feces as number two. And just wait til you find out what they called Number One.
NUMBER ONE:	I’m sure it was appropriately awesome.  We should go to the holodeck and study--
CAPTAIN:	You know, I hate the holodeck, every time I use the damn thing it is literally covered in semen. Have you ever been in there after Commander Worf?!?  Their blood’s not the only thing that’s pink and smells like fish, and he shoots 2 gallons of the stuff EVERY TIME.
NUMBER ONE:	So… You want me to close the holodeck and turn it into a cargo bay?
CAPTAIN:	No, then I couldn’t run my Orion slave girl simulation.  Anyway- let’s jump into the jizz sock, program it to 2015, Fremont, Washington and see what happens.
(Other characters move off stage.)
NUMBER ONE:	Computer. Browse your wildly accurate cultural database and play the most popular piece of music from earth in the year 2015
(Song number ensues.)

(END)

(ENTER Camp counselors BLAH BLAH)
Camp Counselor 1: 	Hey campers!  How’s everyone doing today?  Good?  Well that’s just swell, or, with this heat, should I say… sweltering! I mean, you gotta remember to keep your cool in this summer heat. No reason to get a hot head.  No need to freak out and have big blow out and then quit the league, er, camp.   
Camp Counselor 2:	Well what better way to do that than to get all WET with a fun day packed with water sports! That’s right, today is the day when Camp Trek challenges our old friends at Camp WHAK to a series of watery competitions. The winner of today’s event earns BRAGGING RIGHTS FOR THE WHOLE SUMMER.  Yeah,  lemme hear ya CAMPERS!
(All campers and crowd cheer)
Camp Counselor 1: 	Ok, here at Camp Trek we’ve picked our bridge team, we have red shirt! and blue shirt! We’ll need 2 “champions” from Camp WHAK.
(Trekkies grab one planted WHAKER from the audience and brings them up.) 
Camp Counselor 1:	Oh jeez, looks like we only have one WHAKER who wants to get wet, we’ll need more WHAKERS if this is going to come out right. But don’t worry, we’ve planned for such an eventuality and brought a ringer for you. And  I know how much you guys love ringers. BRING OUT THE GIMP
(Out comes the gimp) 
Camp Counselor 2:	Alright first up we’ll test your accuracy with Golden Showers! <Camp Counselor 1> will go fill up some Golden Water guns for you, it’s time for a classic American challenge, the DUEL!
(Counselor 1 goes behind the bush and fake pees to fill up the guns.)
Camp Counselor 2:	Okay, now walk 10 paces and turn to blow your load, but remember: don’t aim for the face or you will be disqualified. 
(Counselor 1 hands guns to gimp and blue shirt, they start walking their paces but gimp immediately gets on his knees and shoots himself in the face)
Camp Counselor 2: 	Oh no, Gimpy has WHAKED himself. Well it looks like Camp Trek wins this one. Next up is our Water Sports endurance challenge: THE SLIP N SLIDE RELAY RACE.
(Counselor 1 reveals the slip and slide.) 
Camp Counselor 2:	Now this one is really simple campers, your team starts at this end of the slip and slide, you run, you jump, you slide, you hit the bump AND YOU TAKE A RIDE!!  Then, you get up and slide back to your partner, and they do the same thing!  <Camp Counselor 1> can you get the course ready?
Camp Counselor 1:	Sure thing!
(Counselor fake pees all over the slip and slide. Red shirt and WHAKER go to one end.)
Camp Counselor 2:	Okay challengers, on your mark, get set, go.
(WHAKER jumps on first, and wades around on slip and slide, slashing and sliding around.)
Red shirt:	I’ll use the transporter!
(Red shirt cheats by “using the transporter” one trekkie starts at the end of the slip n slide, a transporter noise, then a trekkie in the same color uniform appears on the other side of the slip n slide, they do this twice and win).
Camp counselor 2:	WOW!  Another game won by Camp Trek!  Now campers here comes the final game of finesse, and this one is for all the marbles: the water balloon toss.  Campers, stand three paces apart, and you’ll toss your water balloon to your partner, and whichever team is the farthest apart when their balloon breaks WINS.  <Camp Counselor 1> can you prepare us some balloons?
(Counselor 1 still behind the bush whips out 2 balloons)
Camp counselor 1:	Way ahead of ya!
(Gimp grabs the balloons and immediately breaks it on himself)
Camp Councilor 2:  	Oh drat, we’re going to need more balloons.  <Camp Counselor 1> can you fill any more?
Camp Councilor 1:	Sorry campers, I’m totally drained.
(Gimp takes off mask)
Gimp: 	Ah fuck I need more water! Do you know how hot it is in this mask?
Camp Councilor1: 	Don’t worry Gimpy I filled up a whole cooler full of Wet Cold American PISS to make sure we had enough to cool EVERYONE down!
(Councilor1 acts like we are going to pelt the audience, pulls out a cooler from the bush opens the lid and pulls out a Rainer)
Camp Councilor1:	Who wants a refreshing Rainer!?
(Pass out Rainers to EVERYONE)

Opening: 
(ENTER ABBY and ELMO)
ABBY:		Hey, Elmo! 
ELMO:		Hi, Abby! Why don’t you tell me a joke?
ABBY:	So my friend walked into a doctors office with a carrot in his ear and a piece of celery up his nose. The doctor told him he wasn't eating right.
ABBY & ELMO:	HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
ABBY:		Now Elmo, don’t forget to tell our friends out there what the letter of the day is!
ELMO:	Thanks, Abby! Today’s episode of SKEET STREET was brought to you by the letter M, for Murder!
ELMO:	Tickle, tickle, tickle! (grabs knife and stabs PUPPET 1, then does the ELMO LAUGH)
ABBY:	(horrible death sounds)	
ALL IN BLACK METAL VOICE:	Sunny Day
Sweepin' the clouds away
On my way to where the air is sweet
Can you tell me how to get,
How to get to Skee-ee-eet Street?
 (SIGN: NIGHTMARE ON SKEET STREET slowly raises to top of stage, where it stays)
(EXIT ELMO)
(ENTER ERNIE, in bath tub with soap bubbles and a dildo attached to it)
ERNIE:	Here I am in my tubby again! It’s all filled with water and nice suds… and I’ve got a big fluffy towel to wipe myself down when I’m done! But there’s one other thing that makes tubby time the very best time of the whole day! And you know what that is? It’s my very favorite little pal… I mean BIG PAL…
(Ernie picks up giant dildo and starts playing with it all sexy-like.
SONG:
Rubber dickie, you’re the one!
You make bathtime lots of fun!
Rubber dickie, I’m awfully fond of you… OOOOOooOOOOO!

(ENTER ELMO with knife who murders ERNIE)
ELMO:		TICKLE, TICKLE, TICKLE!
(EXIT ELMO)
(ENTER COOKIE MONSTER)
COOKIE MONSTER:	P is for pussy, and that’s good enough—
(ELMO comes back and murders COOKIE MONSTER)
ELMO:	(laughs. softly.)
 (ENTER COUNT with a picture of MONACO on his eye. As he counts, other puppets come on and start having sex with him and each other)
COUNT:		Greetings! It is I, the Count!
PUPPET 2:	Hey Count, what’s that on your neck?
COUNT:		It’s my Monaco Monicle! (COUNT turns to the audience and stares at them straight-faced)
And it’s time to answer that fascinating question… what is the Skeet Street number of the day, ah ah! Let’s count fucks and find out!
(PUPPET 2 comes up and starts blowing COUNT)
COUNT:		THAT’S ONE! ONE FUCK! 
(PUPPET 3 comes up and starts fucking PUPPET 2 from behind)
COUNT:		TWO! TWO FUCKS! 
(PUPPET 4 comes up and gets in on the DP action with PUPPET 2)
COUNT:		THREE! THREE FABULOUS FUCKS! AH, AH, AH!
COUNT:	What? Nothing? Nothing happened! Isn’t three the number of fucks of the day? But I don’t have any more fucks to give! Where’s the confetti?
(ENTER ELMO)
ELMO:		I’ll give you confetti!
 (ELMO murders everyone. Puppet guts (cotton, yarn, pipe cleaner, googly eyes) flies out from behind the stage while people scream bloody murder.)
(ENTER FERGIE on real stage.)
FERGIE:		So guys… when is the holodeck getting fixed? This show sucks!
(All PUPPETEERS stand wearing Star Trek uniforms and shrugging.)
JONATHAN:	DAMMIT FERGIE, I’M A DOCTOR OF NEUROSCIENCE NOT A PUPPETEER!
