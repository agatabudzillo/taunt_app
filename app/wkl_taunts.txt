(ENTER ARCHEOLOGIST 1 & 2)
ARCHEOLOGIST#1: DrJones, looks like we’ve found an ancient Viking burial site, from the Ballhalla clan.
ARCHEOLOGIST#2: This must be the site of Ragnacock… when they all lost they dicks.
ARCHEOLOGIST#1: It appears that all of the Vikings are trapped in the scissors formation characteristic of the traditional Norse “Fuck Pile.” Except for this one over here all by himself, burnt to a crisp. I wonder what could have happened…
ARCHEOLOGIST 2 (hand to chin): Yes, I wonder…
ARCHEOLOGIST 1 &#2: Doodle ee doo… doodle ee doo… (transition to flashback)
(EXEUNT ARCHEOLOGIST 1 & 2. Vikings come to life, BALLHALLANS 1 & 2 are scissoring while all 3 are cheering and hollering.)
PAUL: BALLHALLANS! As the prophecy has foretold, when the golden star rises in the south, Ragnacock is upon us! And look, behold!
(Enter PAUL or JASON wearing a Timbers jersey & scarf with a sign with a gold star on it that reads “2015 MLS Champions”.)
PAUL: So what enemies shall we battle on this glorious day of Ragnacock?
BALLHALLAN#1: Stroki! Today we face the Bloc Rockers on the field of kickball battle! And what the fuck is a Ragnacock?
BALLHALLAN#2: It’s the end of Ballhalla, the day when we lose all our dicks! Before this day, we have been omnipotent, but after today… we shall be impotent!
PAUL: Onto the longboat, and we shall – ahem  “race the boat” (All BALLHALLANS open a can or gesture with water bottles) East to fight our Russian foes!
(Some sort of weird sailing sight gag, then they land next to a couple BLOC ROCKERS next to the BLOC ROCKER.)
PAUL: I expected an army! What the fuck is this shit! This is fucking stupid! In Ballhalla, when we want to do a taunt, like we’ve been saying for weeks now, we show you a generic stereotype about your team, and then make fun of that stereotype, so I’m gonna have to take my pants off—
(ENTER CHRIS HANSEN)
CHRIS HANSEN: No, you should keep those on, Stroki. Hi, I’m Chris Hansen, and you’re on To Catch a Pillager.
(sets down a folding chair)
CHRIS HANSEN: Why don’t you have a seat for me?
PAUL (sits): What the fuck is this shit? This is fucking stupid! I don’t understand, I swear I’ve never done this before, this is all a big misunderstanding—
CHRIS HANSEN: No, that is the problem Stroki. You have done this exact taunt before, and we have it on video. Just go to Facebook, and you’ll see this is at least the 4th or 5th time you’ve done it. You walk in, you say “What the fuck is this shit? This is fucking stupid! This is how Vikings do it…”
PAUL: But the Hell Razors do the same taunt every week as well! You know, a weak skit entirely supporting a parody song…
CHRIS HANSEN: Yeah, they do do that, but they’re funny, and they have props. But you’re right, that’s shitty and repetitive too. So give me your script.
PAUL: I don’t wanna.
CHRIS HANSEN: Give me the script!
PAUL: No, I don’t wanna!
CHRIS HANSEN: No, Stroki, you have to stop abusing the trope. This taunt formula is so old that it belongs in a museum. 
ARCHEOLOGIST 1 and/or 2 YELL FROM OFF STAGE: IT BELONGS IN A MUSEUM!
CHRIS HANSEN: And now we’re gonna lay it, and you, to rest.
PAUL: Well, can I go out like a Viking?
CHRIS HANSEN: You mean, you want to get lit on fire in a boat? 
PAUL: Yes… 
CHRIS HANSEN: Okay, just Ballhobble on over there then.
(Paul limps over to the boat.)
CHRIS HANSEN: You promise you’ll never do this taunt again?
PAUL: Yeah, I promise!
CHRIS HANSEN: And you want to go out like a Viking?
PAUL: Yeah! A big, scary Viking!
CHRIS HANSEN: Then it’s time to be cleansed in the fires… of RAGNACOCK! (ALL IN BACKGROUND START AIR GUITARING WHILE YELLING METAL JUNT JUNT JUNTS and chanting “Ragnacock! Ride the cock!” in metal voice. Chris Hansen pours out some Fireball over PAUL. Then he lights a match and throws it at him. Flame fx using the flame props.)
CHRIS HANSEN: Ballhallans! We now lay this shitty taunt idea to rest! And now, you shall join us, as everyone must partake in the fires of Ragnacock!
(Metal shit continues. Hand out shots of Fireball to everyone.) 

(SCENE: Large wrestling ring. Announcers off to the side.)
ANNOUNCER#2:  For the thousands in attendance, for the millions around the world watching this on Facebook, ladies and gentlemen, the World Wide West Coast Kickball Wrestling League proudly presents our 30th main event, a tag team, whipit cream, possibly drag queen match, pin ‘em to win royal rumble. So…
ANNOUCERS#1&2: LEEEEEEET’S GET READY TO RUMBLE!
(lots of smoke and fan fair. A group “sings” the “Ya’ll ready for this” wrestling song: https://youtu.be/VOvDTCbcHe0?t=17s )
ANNOUNCER#1: Well, let’s start this off! Our first contestant for WWWKWLXXX is coming down the ramp now, standing in at six foot nothing in heels, the dopest pope that ever doped, coming off a four year steroids ban, it’s… Pope Purkey!  He’s got a direct line to god, but must have done something to offend him because our kickball games keep getting rained out!
(POPE PURKEY gets in the ring to much fanfare, a group of folks sing “all righty then” behind him: https://youtu.be/WhI_SDEvJ4?t=14s   He goes to his corner and acts all dopey popey)
POPE PURKEY (acting authentically nice): Thank you, thank you, I just hope everybody has a good time tonight and has a lot of fun.
ANNOUNCER#2: Yeah, what’s up with this weather? At this rate, we’re gonna be playing the 2017 season on an ark!
ANNOUNCER#1: Round up all the furries!
ANNOUNCER#2: Oh no, coming down the ramp now, we have our second contestant.  She’s sure to NOT be the crowd’s favorite.  Weighing in at 110lbs, with 20 lbs of stick up her ass, It’s craaazy neighbor lady and her herd of cats!  Let’s me hear you make a whole lot of noise for the lady who considers this public park HER yard.
(CRAZY NEIGHBOR LADY comes in to much crazy fanfare and Singing. She gets to her corner and acts crazy)
All singing: Crazy Neighbor Lady, Crazy Neighbor Lady, Crazy Neighbor Lady, Crazy Neighbor Lady… put your tents down.
CNL: That’s right, there’s not any tents allowed, there’s not any amplification allowed, there’s not any booze allowed, there’s not any smoking allowed, there’s not any fun allowed. Not tonight! Not in my yard!
ANNOUNCER 2 (eating a sandwich and talking with his mouth full): She’s a real delight to be around.
ANNOUNCER#1:  Well, look at these sad sacks of shit.  Looks like these two have to play three quarters of an entire kick ball season in less than 3 weeks.  It’s the dudes with pubes on their cubes, the pube dudes with a bunch of noobs, it TKO’s… Miles and Durst!
(MILES and DURST come in with umbrellas and pillows to very tired fanfare. They go to their corner and take a nap)
DURST: Man, I forgot how exhausting kickball was.
MILES: Yeah, the only way this season could be more tiring is if we weren’t getting carried through every game by all our rookies.
ANNOUNCER#2: And here comes the gruesome twosome that you wanna do some. It’s the sexational, inspirational, exceptional, intellectual polish pounder, the lady with the iron meat curtains, the lovers from soviet mothers…
(Cyril and Agata come in to much sexy fanfare. They get to their corner and make out.)
ANNOUNCER#2: Oh hot damn! 
ANNOUNCER#1: Yes it’s Axl Hammer and Sickle Slash.
REFEREE: Okay, this is a royal rumble, once you’ve been pinned for a three count, you’re out, last team standing takes home the belt. (hold up belt) I want a good fight, not a clean fight. Now that we’re ready… Leeeeeet’s actually rumble!
ANNOUNCER#1: And they’re off, it looks like the lovers from Soviet mothers are busy sucking face, but TKO is too busy counting sheep to get any action either
ANNOUNCER#2: TKO can’t get any action? What else is new? AYOOOOOOO. It looks like it’s CNL and the pope to start us off.
FIGHT 1
DURING FIGHTS: ANNOUNCERS generally are reacting – wincing, “OH SHIT!” “That’s gotta hurt!” &c.
POPE offers his hand to CRAZY NEIGHBOR LADY, CNL kicks him in the dick. POPE falls to his knees, gets punched in the face and falls down. CNL does a boo hiss victory lap.
CNL: Down with fun! Up with early bedtimes!
Comes up behind the POPE, chokes him out. POPE breaks free and does the ultimate fighting move (blow to the stomach to break the head lock, then a punch to the face, then a hit to the groin, then a punch to the face then a hit to the groin etc). POPE pins CNL while Ref pounds the count on the mat. She rolls out.
REF: She’s down for the count! Congratulations on beating up an old lady, and that isn’t creepy or weird at all!
POPE begins to pray.
POPE: Our father Hiram, who art in Texas, shallow be his game… deliver us this day our daily brisket, and forgive us our thread deleting. And lead us not into getting superbutthurt, but deliver us from boring taunts….
FIGHT 2
TKO wakes up and watches the action.
MILES: Art thou bored? SNAP INTO A SLIM JIM! (Throws Slim Jims to audience)
Once the POPE prays TKO double clothesline the POPE.  POPE falls to the ground and TKO kicks the POPE as he tries to crawl away. POPE sits up, his hat knocked off, MILES drags him by the hair to a corner, where they punch him in the face three times.
DURST: Somebody call the Cardinals! ‘Cuz when we’re done, it’s gonna be time for a new… PAPAL CONCLAVE.
POPE is then thrown into the middle of the ring, MILES sits on the POPE’s face, DURST sits on his crotch, they pin him while the ref pounds the count on the mat.
REF: And heeeee’s out! 
MILES: OH, YEAHHHHH!
FIGHT 3
CYRIL and AGATA stop making out for like 3 seconds and see what’s going on. They both kick MILES and DURST off of the POPE.
MILES: OH, NO!
They both slap the shit out of them in opposite corners.  AGATA swings around MILES, CYRIL swings around DIRST, and DURST and MILES collide in the middle of the ring. CYRIL and AGATA do the Hamish hammer finishing move.  They win.
CYRIL: Huh, in America, your wrestlers tell you to snap into a slim jim (throws slim jims out to the crowd).  In Russia, you suck on my fat borris.  (big old pickle joke) 

(SCENE: opens with a generic WKL person walking around looking at their phone. Bloc Rocker comes up to them.)
Russian Trainer: Hello Comrade of the WKL.  We have heard of game that is sweeping the world, Pokemon Go.  We hear is very popular. Well in Russia, we have much better game called PokeaWitch Go. Or Witcheymon Go. Or Baba Yaga, No! Name is not important
Player: Um, that sounds… fun? Do you have to catch the witches?
Trainer: No, individual ownership is crime against the proletariat. You have to burn the witches, burn them all.
Player: (Looking at phone). I’m not seeing it on the app store?
Trainer: Is not available on capitalist pig Steve Jobs app store. You must go to the people’s app store. Here, give me phone. (Takes phone and taps around). There, now we just need to wait in queue for our turn to download.
Hands phone back to player. Long pause.
Player: OK, so I have the app running.  I’ve made a witch burner, and now it’s thinking… thinking… okay! Wait, no… thinking… here we go!
(A matt hasting appears.)
Trainer: This is a Hasting Witch, don’t worry is very basic.
Player: Okay, so, how do I neutralize a basic witch?
Enter scientist
Scientist:  Actually, neutralizing a basic witch is very easy  <basic scientific explanation of acid blah blah>
Exit scientist
Player: Okay, so…?
Trainer:  So now you just throw pentaballs at him until he burns. They’re made of vinyl records. Basic Witches are suckers for anything on vinyl.
Player throws pentaball at Hastings. Hastings spins and screams.
Player:  Burn witch! Get out the way, get out the way witch, get out the way! 
Russian Prop Person: CHEMICAL BURN!
Player: That was awesome, but now I’m out of Pentaballs?  What do I do?
Trainer: Well, look at map, see blue beacon? Is Pentastop, we walk there
Both walk over to Honey Bucket
Trainer: Okay, now you spin icon, get pentaballs and other treats.
Player: Easy enough. 
Player spins the porta potty sign, out comes penta balls and a big poop
Player: Cool I got pentaballs and this big brown squishy egg thing, and it smells
Trainer:  Like shit? 
Player: (Disgusted) Yes…
Trainer: Is shit.
Prop Person: Shitty BURN!
Player:  Awww gross!  (looks at phone) Okay, let’s go find some witches. (they walk over to the sand pit) Goddamnit, this game sucks, there aren’t any basic witches anywhere.  What is it, slightly drizzling out or something?
Trainer: Well, you should use a lure. 
Player: How do I get a lure?
Trainer: Just give me credit card… Actually, never mind, you’re logged in with Google, I already have it.  Here’s your lure. (pulls PBR out of pocket) Just set down this PBR, some basic witches are sure to appear.
Player: (sets down PBR and waves hands over it) Calling all the basic witches, calling all the basic witches.  This just in… you’re basic.
(Scottyzar and Mammachu appear)
Trainer: Look! Is Scottyzar and Mammachu
Scottyzar: I quit the league! I quit my job! I quit! I quit!
Mammachu: Not the Mamma!  Not the mamma!
Trainer: How do I neutralize these two?
Russian: I think you need to use something they both want. Try spawning the spawn.
(Player does something on phone, in walks Fergs with Hamish in a dress)
MammaChu: Cute baby!  Cute baby!
Scottyzar:  Woah, whose daughter is that? She’s fierce
Trainer: Quick! While they’re distracted
(Player throws penta balls at the two, they come out of records labeled something from our first taunt, both Scottyzar and Mamachu are disabled)
Fergs: I think I’m going to become a Satanist, just for the hell of it.
PropPerson: Dad Joke Burn!
Player: Hey look over there, it’s like a big boss, in some sort of tower, what is that?
Trainer: Oh, is the OLDTIMEYJIM.  There won’t be any basic witches there. They’re just not on his level any more.
(3 people wander around looking at their phones)
Player: (Pointing at phone people). Look at all those ass holes just looking at their phones.
Trainer: Yes, this game is more popular than Jasmin at biker bar.  Because, you know, she’s really fun to hang out with, at bars.  And she sometimes hangs out with people who ride motorcycles. And motorcycles are fun.
Player: Okay, so are there any legendary witches here?
Trainer: No, they all basic. 

(SCENE: BLOC ROCKER is on stage, under a sheet hiding a pile of books.)
Two Breeders stagger in, frustrated and in pain.
BREEDER 1 (wincing in pain): Oh my god, I’m so sore.
BREEDER 2 (eating chocolate): I’m so bloated. I can’t even get out of this suit. I’m just gonna lay down like this for the rest of the week.
BREEDER#1: It isn’t just us, the entire team is being taken down by this red menace.  McCarthy was right, there are communists everywhere, and they’re taking us out one by one.
BREEDER#2: I know, first we lost Commie Mike… I mean, obviously we were gonna lose Commie Mike, he’s a goddamn commie.
BREEDER#1: Then we lost the scarlet letter. Not surprising, she really loves red and red is kind of the whole communist thing.
BREEDER#2: But then we lost Luke, I think he drove his electric trike off a cliff in a fit of red rage.
BREEDER#1: Yeah, but he was such a cock potato, he’d always get mashed at games and during taunts he’d just be fried.  Hell, I think he was just a little bit tattered.
BREEDER#2: Cock potoato? Because he forces us to recite his terrible puns?
BREEDER#1: No, I  mean, he’s a dicktater.
BREEDER#2: A dicktater? I thought he was a spuddick.
BREEDER#1: Goddamnit his terrible puns have infected us all faster than pokemon go.
Enter BREEDER 3. Looking okay.
BREEDER#3: Hey guys, what’s wrong?
BREEDER#2:  Our vaginas are weeping and we can’t stop making terrible puns…
BREEDER#3: Wait, is Aunt Flow visiting you too?
BREEDER#1: Yeah, it’s shark week and this entire league is afraid to get in the water if you know what I mean.
BREEDER#2: Megashark vs giant flowtopus over here.
BREEDER#1: We’ll be redder than a Stark wedding!
BREEDER#2: Bloodier than the elevator shaft in the Shining!
BREEDER#3: Surfing the Crimson Wave?
BREEDER#1: Red Tide!
BREEDER#2: Riding the cotton pony.
BREEDER#3: Have we all fallen to the communists?
BREEDER#1: Yes. It is that time of the month.
(ENTER AGATA, in Marie Antoinette outfit)
AGATA: Oh, I just LOVE period pieces!
(EXIT AGATA)
BREEDER#2: Well, the bleeding’s fine but I am sick of being closed for maintenance!
BREEDER#3: Yeah, if I don’t get laid we’ll be Bleeding Rainbow. We need to solve this, and FAST.
(ENTER BLOC ROCKER LIBRARIAN. LIBRARIAN pulls table cloth off of BLOC ROCKER to reveal a shelf of books.)
LIBRARIAN: You know, whenever I can’t get laid, I just find a good fantasy… uh, novel.
BREEDER#3: That’s right! Just take a look, it’s in a book! Let’s read some cliterature!
LIBRARIAN: Why not try something from our sexist reeducation section? For instance, we have Flolita, Red Dawn, and the Cunnalingus Manifesto over here.
(BRODSKY laughs from audience. “IS FUNNY RUSSIAN JOKE!”)
BREEDER#1: Ooh, the Hunt For Red Cocktober! Das Cock and Balls!
BREEDER#2: Oh wow, look at these great movies! Das Booty and The Battleship PoonTempting!
BREEDER#3: A Red River Runs Through It, and Where The Red Pad Goes.
LIBRARIAN: Let me recommend a personal favorite… Menstrual Farm! This book teaches that “red wings good, no wings bad”. So really, all of you must band together and realize that a dicktater isn’t the way to go. You might all feel a little bloated and crampy right now but you can relish in the solidarity that you all have red wings and those red wings will help you rise up and fly higher than a triple rainbow. 

(Enter Fergs)
FERGS: (singing)
When you bleed I can fly
With these red wings I’ll touch the sky
Plow through the red tide every night and day.
Even if you say no… wait I learned that that is NOT okay.

We can cuddle if you’re sore
Or I can go in through the back door
Think of me as your meat tampon,
And let me spread your meat curtons
Then we can go out for a steak
‘Cuz you’ll need to up your iron intake
ALL:
When you bleed we will fly
Digging deep into your bloody thighs.
Thanks to you our crotches look tie dyed.
We can pleasure your bloody vee
And please don’t worry we got new sheets

Hand out Cris’ tampon jello shots.
FIN

(Enter LEIF & JONATHAN)
LEIF:		Oh wow, I can’t believe we beat the shit out of TKO AND Baewatch!
JONATHAN:	Oh shit wrong script! (swap scripts)
LEIF:		Hey, sooooo we’re running really late to the Festival of Losers.
JONATHAN:	Yeah, sometimes I get really bummed about playing in the Festival of Losers EVERY YEAR but I just love the WKL soooo much!
(Walk up to scoreboard with SOFT TACO PENIS QUIET and COMPLICATED CHRISTIANS signs)
LEIF:	Some joker swapped out our placard just like on the taunt trophy! “Soft Taco Penis Quiet,” huh.
JONATHAN:	That’s weird… Hey, it’s the witches over there. Are you ready for the Festival of Losers?
SARAH:	“Festival of Losers?” What’s that? It’s Championship Day – get ready tacos, because you’re playing our team—the Complicated Christians—in the first game! 
JASMINE:	Why would you celebrate losers? Kickball is serious business!
SARAH:	The bottom two teams are relegated to go play in Overcat, this junior league where they sing songs and drink beer and act like a bunch of children.
JASMINE:	Yeah, it’s disgusting!
LEIF (pulls JONATHAN aside):	Did you hear what they just said? We’re playing in Championship day! Do you know what that means?
JONATHAN:	YES! Obviously, we’re trapped in some Bizarro world mirror universe where everything is the opposite of our world!
ALL:	DUN DUN DUN!
LEIF (To CHRISTIANS):	Hey! So we’ve never been to Championship day. What are the rules?
SARAH:	Well, it’s just like the rules for every other kickball game.
JONATHAN:	Yeah… so… what are the rules to kickball, again?
JASMINE:	Well, it’s complicated, like the love of Christ. 
SARAH:	Yeah, you should probably go to TKO for that. 
LEIF:		Oh! So The Kickball Order is here?
JASMINE:	No, The Kickball Originals! They’ve been in the league forever – some say they invented the sport of kickball itself! Amen.
(Team travels to the Kickball Originals.)
SARAH and JASMINE:	May the Lord be with you.
(EXIT SARAH and JASMINE)
(Kickball Original with cane)
TKO: 		Welcome young bucks! Welcome to the bizarro world! Oh no, Oh no.
JONATHAN:	Wait, do you know who we are?
TKO:		Oh no. Oh no.
LEIF:		Don’t you mean “OH YEAH”?
TKO: 	Oh no. But you are not the first WKL team to come in my realm. The last one was Amathong. I’m afraid they never made it back.
(Find Paul in crowd. We point to the actual Paul in the crowd. )
JONATHAN:	Wait, is that Paul? Do you have a Balhalla here? We have one of those in our world!
TKO:	Yeah, I know, some things are the same in both universes.
LEIF:	I guess the opposite of zero… is still zero.
JONATHAN:	So how do we get back you our world?
TKO:	Even I do not know, but Neutered and Shorn will be your guide. He can take you to the most wretched hive of scum and villainy in Fremont… the Hostile Hostel.
(NEUTERED AND SHORN leads them to HOSTILE HOSTEL. GNO is walking out, carrying Awesome Prop.)
GNO:		Hey guys, I’m going to bed… you know, Bro’s Night Alone. I’m just tired from our amazing taunt full of superawesome props.
(Enter Hostile Hostel.)
(Enter LUKE.)
LEIF:		Hey, it’s Luke! Aren’t you glad this place isn’t the Dubliner anymore?
LUKE: 		Huh?
LEIF: 		You know, since you got 86’ed for pouring your outside beer into their inside can?
LUKE: 	Beer? Never touch the stuff. Clean and healthy living for this guy – I’m definitely gonna live past 40. How else are you going to be the best kickball sports team of all time?! This is a milk and cookie bar. The lines are so great here – you can wait in them for hours.
(Waitress comes out with Oreo cookie jello shots for the audience.)
JONATHAN:	Oh, you get to stand in line for a really long time and then you get meager rations? Oh, it’s just like Mother Russia!
LUKE: 		Oh fiddlesticks, it’s almost#6:30, we’ve got to get going soon!
LEIF: 		Why? Is it last call?
LUKE: 	No, it’s time for everyone to go to bed! Except for Heidi and Andrea, those crazy party animals who are always up all night!
(Enter DANNY)
DANNY:		Hey guys, you left before we won!
JONATHAN: 	Wait what?
DANNY: 	Our team! Soft Taco Penis Quiet! We just beat the Heaven’s Ravers for the kickball championship!
JONATHAN: 	Danny Cifaldi? You’re on our team?
DANNY: 	No, I’m Dani Nelson! Leif’s gay lover! From the South! Of course I’m on your team, I’m so superloyal I would never leave your team! Especially not to join a team with TICE TICE OLD MAN or BUTTERFINGERS EMORY or DUBS.
(LEIF and DANNY MAKE OUT, TONGUE WOULD REALLY SELL IT).
LEIF: 		I could stay here forever!
(ENTER BOOLEEN with sign that says “COOLLEEN”)
BOOLEEN: 	Alright, Curfew Crew! It’s time to go to bed!
JONATHAN: 	What, Coolz? Why would you say that?
BOOLEEN: 	What, who’s “Coolz”? I’m BOOLEEN! (flips sign to “BOOLEEN”) I’m the Commissioner’s enforcer! I’m here to say boo on drinking, boo on fun, boo on each and every one! Because kickball is serious business!
LEIF: 		Wait, but fun is the most important part of kickball!
MEANA (off stage): 	DID SOMEONE SAY FUN?!?
BOOLEEN: 	Oh, you’ve done it now. Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.
(ENTER COMMISSIONER MEANA. EVERYONE in the bar but LUKE runs away.)
MEANA: 	There will be none of the fun while I’m in charge! No hugging allowed!
LUKE: 		Run! It’s the commissioner!
LEIF:		Tina’s the commissioner?
LUKE: 		That’s not Tina! That’s Meana! The meanest commissioner of all! 
JONATHAN:	Wait, I know exactly how to stop Meana! Our Tina loves karaoke more than anything! It’s in her DNA, and I should know because I’m a scientist!
LEIF: 		Yeah, I brought my Magic Mike double XL with me! That’ll do it!
(Leif pulls out giant microphone)
(MEANA rips it out of his hands and rips it in half.)
MEANA: 	I! HATE! KARAOKE!
LEIF & JONATHAN & LUKE:	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
JONATHAN:	We’re doomed!
LEIF: 	Wait, wait! I know exactly what’ll stop Tina! We need ripped abs! Who will have really ripped abs in this bizarro world?
JONATHAN:	Fergs! We need Bizarro Fergs!
(Enter JACOB)
JACOB:		Do you mean me? I’m Jergie!
LEIF: 		We need you to take off your shirt!
JACOB: 		I’m not really into that. I would really like it if you all stopped objectifying me.
JONATHAN: 	But you need to! For the good of the league!
(JACOB takes off his shirt.)
MEANA: 	Noooo I can’t handle such amazing abs! The horror! The horror! I’m melting! I’m melting!
(JONATHAN & LEIF start clicking their heels)
JONATHAN & LEIF: 	There’s no place like BF Day! There’s no place like BF Day! Razors, Rainbows, and Rockers! Oh my! Razors, Rainbows, and Rockers! Oh my! SMOKE!
(JONATHAN & LEIF pick up a blanket while people hold pillows or something and then wake up from a dream maybe with other members of team as themselves.)
JACOB:	Hey guys, you’ve gotta wake up. It’s actually championship day, and beyond all logic and reason you have to both play games and taunt. (Checks watch.) Actually, you’ve already lost the game. But you still have to finish this taunt.
LEIF:	Oh wow, I just had the craziest dream and (points to JONATHAN) you were there and (points to JACOB’S abs one by one) you were there and you were there and you were there…
JONATHAN:	Wait, is this really our world? Jacob, who’s commissioner of the WKL?
JACOB:	Purkey!
(LEIF & JONATHAN shrug)
LEIF:	Eh, good enough.
(Exit JACOB. Rest of the Block Rockers all rush in)
FERGS:		Hey, where’ve you guys been? It’s almost the end of the taunt!
JONATHAN:	Shit! How’re we gonna end this?
LEIF:	End with a song?
EVERYONE:	Yeah!

Wise men say
Only fools bunt in
But I can’t help
Falling in love with the WKL

Take my liver
Take my whole summer too
For I can’t help falling in love with you
(Reveal WKL = <3 JellO Shot sign)

(Three nerds sit at a table playing a nerd game stage right. When they play out the game it’s acted out by Divas on stage left. )

NERD MASTER: 	Well, excellent my intrepid warriors, you exit the arena after an awesome display of fierce action.  You round a corner and BAM you confront a pack of DirePaparazzi.  Roll for initiative?
NERD#1: 	I summon an entourage, a group of douche bags surround them to block us from their invasive gaze! (rolls dice)
NERD#2: 	I use my trusty iron heel and lash out at the nearest photographer smashing his camera! (rolls dice) YES!
NERD MASTER:	Your entourage only surrounds one reporter with a tape recorder but all the photographers are taking pics of the fight and MORE PHOTOGRAPHERS are headed THIS WAY! Quick Divas, escape to the waiting limousine!
NERD#1: 	Is there booze and druge in said limousine?
NERD MASTER: 	Of course!
NERD#1:	I want to party like it’s 1999
NERD MASTER:	Well, give me a roll! Roll a D20
NERD#1:	More like roll double deez nuts!
MAMADONNA:	 Boys! Boys I’m coming down the stairs now! I’ve got rice crispy treats and pootie tang!
NERD MASTER: 	mom, mom, MOMMADONNA!   We’re BUSY down here, JEEEZE!
MAMADONNA:	Boys, its fine, I don’t care what you’re doing down there, remember, I’m like a virgin too!  Now what are you guys playing down here? The Hearthstone, magic or Dungeons and Dragons?
NERD#2: 	Dungeons and Dragons? Pffhhhh… mom, what do you think this is 1975? No, we’re playing the new DND game Divas n Divas!
NERD MASTER:	Yeah Mom, it’s super cool, you wouldn’t understand it! You play the DIVAS from across all known time and space to do super cool stuff with babes n stuff!
NERD 2	Yeah, babes and stuff!
NERD#1:	Yeah, stuff. He, he, he. (nerd laughter ensues and gets real snorty and donkey like, think Revenge of the Nerds)
NERD MADONNA:	Well, can I play?
NERDS 1+2:	YEAH!
NERD MASTER:	Oh geeze. (rolls eyes)  Ok Pick a PHDiva to play. 
NERD MADONNA:	OK, this one sucks, this one is dead, you already have a bard so there no reason to play this one.. oh I want to play Andy Whoreballs!
<Enter SAM>
NERD MADONNA:	oh yeah, he’s got high intelligence, super high sexual charisma, and a huge donger.  I’ll pick him.  But I want him to look different..
NERD#1:	Well you can change his appearance any way you want!
NERD MADONNA:	Ok, these pants are great, but I want shorter shorts (she rips off sams pants to reveal short shorts)  Awesome! Now how do we slay the dragon?
NERD MASTER:	Jeeeeeeze Mom! We don’t slay dragons, we soak up the limelight and use it’s power to become watered down versions of our predecessors.
NERD#1:	But KISS uses weapons, and so does Rammstein, she could totally have a sick ass sword!
NERD MASTER:	NO WAY!  Those bands use props, not real swords!
NERD#2:	But it’s make believe, she can do whatever she wants!
NERD MASTER:	NO WAY! 
NERDS 1+2: 	YES WAY!
NERD MASTER:	NERD FIGHT!
(Nerd fight ensues. Enter LEMMY from Motorhead)
LEMMY:	Break it up, break it up. Looks like we’ve found another case for Judge Gaga, the Diva’s judge, I’m your bailiff Lemmy from motorhead, and this is Gaga court.
(Enter JUDGE GAGA)
JUDGE GAGA:	Nerds. Dorks. Poindexters, goobers, and dweebs.  Today we hear the case about some dorks who have a problem. Let’s hear the case.
NERD MASTER:	Your honor, my mother wants to play DnD, and wants to play Andy Whoreballs with a giant sword
NERD#1:	Well it doesn’t have to be –
GAGA:		Wait, wait, wait.  You’re nerds, right?  Like magic missiles and trek yourself? 
NERD MASTER:	Well, yeah.  But we’re totally different from those teams, cause… uh… cause we’re nerds.
GAGA: 		Silence goober Seems like we’ve uncovered a more important case here.  SERIAL PLAGARISM!
NERD MASTER: 	No no, you see, we’re not the same as those teams because we do a poppy parody song in every taunt!  They only did parody songs, like once and a while.
GAGA:		Can you deny that you used a micro taunt formula that culminated in an AC/DC parody song for your championship taunt, USING	THE EXACT SONG FRENCH CONNECTION USED?
NERD#2: 	uh, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery?  
GAGA:		I SAID SILENCE. This case is far beyond the reach of myself, the peoples judge, I’ll have to pass this on to the Queen
FREDDY MERCURY:  	Nope too rich for my blood, this one has to go to God.
(Enter ALANIS MORISSETTE)
NERD MASTER:	Oh wow, god IS a woman
NERD#1:	And it’s Alanis Morissette, like in that Kevin smith movie, “Dogma.”
NERD#2:	Kevin Smith was right all along!
ALANIS: 	Nerds, Mamadona. Allow me to teach you a lesson by using a song I adapted to suit this special situation
Ironic Lyrics:
An old idea turned ninetyeight
you worked it into a taunt, now isn’t it great
It's a pop fly in to your third base
It's a parody song, and a dance routine that’s safe
Weren't they iconic, don't you think
[Chorus—]
It's like rain on opening day
It's a lame joke you took from tv
It's the same old taunt
That’s been done all the time, but you win, so it figures
MrKevinTice was afraid to try
He packed his cooler and kissed his kids goodbye
He waited his whole damn life to taunt that night
And as the jokes crashed down he thought
"Well, at least my name is Tice."
And isn't it all ironic, don't you think


(SCENE OPENS: Fergie is standing on stage, alone.)
LEIF:		
FERGIE:	DIVAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSS! We regulate any stealing of our trophies / And we damn fabulous too / But you can't be any nerd from the 206, / Gotta be handy with stiletto heels if you know what I mean, to earn your keep! / Divas! mount up!
(DIVAS walk up to tent and knock on door. LEIF has fuzzy handcuffs on and a burlap sack on his head and is jerkin’ it into a sock.)
LEIF:		I’ll be right there!
(LEIF zips up pants and pulls burlap sack off and still has handcuffs on one wrist)
LEIF:		Hey guys, you’re early for taunt planning?
FERGIE:	No, we’re on time for torture.
LEIF:		Torture?
FERGIE:	Torture!
LEIF:		Uh, me?
FERGIE:	Yeah, you.
(SOMEONE grabs the burlap sack and puts it on LEIF’S head then shoves him back into his chair then takes it off again while FERGIE pulls out his phone and calls Dani. When the phone starts ringing, he walks around the front of the office showing her photo and name on his phone while it rings. One of the DIVAs is aggressively eating Nerds throughout the entire taunt.)
FERGIE:	DANI! Nerds better have my trophy! If you don’t hand over the taunt trophy right now we’re going to take your precious lover and commit a series of horrific acts.
DANI:		…….
FERGIE:	That’s right! NERD TORTURE!
LEIF:		No, not nerd torture! Wait, why should I care about that? I’m a diva, not a nerd!
DIVA#1:	But you’re a nerd by common law marriage!
LEIF:		You’re right! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THAT’S TERRIBLE
DIVA#2:	Leif, you’ve seen the trailer for The Last Jedi, right? Well, I just read the screenplay and Luke is Rey’s father… and mother!
LEIF:		NOOOOOOOOOO THAT’S IMPOSSIBLE
DIVA#11:	Spoiler alert (walks by with spoiler)
DIVA#2:	That’s right! It’s just like the hit 1994 Arnold Schwarzenegger film Junior!
LEIF:		No, that’s… rather implausible?
(DIVA 1 pulls out Star Wars action figure.)
FERGIE:	Diva 1 has an original 1977 Kenner Star Wars action toy… in the ORIGINAL BLISTER PACK.
LEIF:		Not original edition misprint Chewbacca with the blond hair!
FERGIE:	It’d be a shame if someone… opened it.
(DIVA 1 & 2 pull package and throws it into the audience.)
LEIF:		No! Think of the resale value!
EVERYONE:	Nerds better have my trophy trophy trophy trophy
(DIVAS 3 AND 4 pull out conspicuously giant feathers and start tickling Leif)
LEIF:		Guys. I said last night NO FUCKING TICKLING. Laughs uncontrollably hahaha no stop, hahaha don’t 
FERGIE:	Hear those screams, Dani? I’m fingerblasting his special places!
EVERYONE:		Nerds better have my trophy trophy trophy
(DIVAS 5 AND 6 step up with a laptop and a phone)
DIVA#5:		We just installed Windows Millennium Edition on your laptop! (shows off laptop screen to audience)
LEIF:			No, how could you? That’s where I keep my porn!
DIVA#6:		Well if you miss Windows 10 so bad… here’s a Windows phone! (throws him a phone)
LEIF:			No! My other porn!
EVERYONE:		Nerds better have my trophy trophy trophy
FERGIE:	What, Dani? You think this is a fucking JOKE? Let me show you the PUNCH line!

(SOUNDFX: “Under the sea”)
EVERYONE:		Sex in the sea
			Sex in the sea
			Darling it’s better
			Down where it’s wetter
			You’ll take it from me!
			Up on the shore they jerk all day
			Out in the sun they ‘bate away
			While we devotin’
			Full time to bonin’
			Sex in the sea!
JACQUES COUSTEAU:	Hello, and welcome to this week’s episode of “Sex in the Sea!” Let’s dive right into the wettest depths this week and talk about the reproductive habits of the merfolk.
(ENTER TWO MERMEN AND A MERMAID)
COUSTEAU:	Mermaids take many sexual partners. So when a mermaid likes one or more mermen very much, which leads to foreplay…
(MERFOLK MAKEOUTS)
COUSTEAU:	And then, when she reaches the peak of her arousal, like any other fish the mermaid then drops her clutch of eggs.
(MERMAID drops a six pack of eggs on theground.)
COUSTEAU:	And then, the mermen, with their fish bottom halves, bring themselves to orgasm and inseminate the eggs, while the mermaid wanders off to find more partners.
MERMAN#1:	Hold on, we don’t even have dicks!
MERMAID:	Wait what? This sucks!
MERMAN#2:	No, wait! I swear I had one somewhere!
(EXIT MERFOLK)
COUSTEAU:	And now we move on to the most germridden, scurviest, hiccuphaving, bottomfeeders of the ocean… I speak of course, of the pirate. Here we see two pirates meeting on a moonlit night… on the poop deck.
(ENTER PIRATES – they both have beards – maybe one of the beards is a merkin. Or both.)
PIRATE#1:	Blackbeard, I’ve got to warn you – I’ve got the crabs down there.
PIRATE#2:	No worries, redbeard, I’ve got lobsters meself.
PIRATE#1:	Oof! You stink! How much rum have you had today?
PIRATE#2: 	I’ve been drinking just as much as something something sam ali’s boat. 
Pirate#1: 	We’re getting really lazy with these jokes!
Pirate#2: 	Yes we yarrr!
BUNCH O’ PIRATES:	YARRRRRRRR YARR YARR YARR
Pirate#1:	Ok, hold me hook I’m going in!
PIRATE#2:	No, peg me! And make sure you watch out for splinters!
PIRATE#1:	Oof, sorry, after all that rum today, I’m stuff at halfmast.
PIRATE#2: 	Come on, it’s like you’re pushing rope!
COUSTEAU:	Unfortunately, due to their excessive drinking behavior, pirate sex often just ends in frustration, sadness, and even more drinking.
(EXIT PIRATES)
COUSTEAU:	And now we move on to the octopus, the diva of the sea.
(ENTER URSULA and ANOTHER OCTOPUS)
COUSTEAU:	So as we can see here, the octopus has one tentacle longer than the rest, the “mating arm.”
URSULA:	Ooh, hey there, big fellow, I like the look of your semen wand!
COUSTEAU:	Because of its extraordinary size and prehensile flexibility, the octopus may have the most amazing sex in the entire animal kingdom!
OCTOPUS:	Let me gaze into your eyes… with my dick arm!
URSULA:	Why don’t you take that thing and shove it in my earhole to deposit your sperm! YES YES YES SCRAMBLE MY BRAINS WITH YOUR DICK ARM!
(COUSTEAU unveils anatomic diagram)
COUSTEAU:	No seriously, folks, that’s exactly how it works! He sticks that dick right in her ear and comes in it!		
OCTOPUS:	(orgasms, then leaves)
JACQUES COUSTEAU:	But sometimes, the female may have buyer’s remorse and remove the semen later.
(URSULA palms / removes sperm packet from her ear and throws it into the crowd)
(SOUNDFX: National Geographic theme)

DIVAs walk onto BF Day Playfield. On the Bleachers side of the fence, Ballshank Redemption (BSR) stands, chained together. DIVAs taunt BSR with a stick on the fence, mugs, rattling the fence, and warm up kicking kickballs against the fence at BSR. DIVAs say “Mean Taunty Things” 
Diva#1:  “…You know what they say, “Once you kill a cow you gotta make a burger.”
Diva#2:  Trust is like a mirror. You can fix it if it’s broke…
Diva#1: …But you can still the crack in that mother fuckers reflection
Diva#3:  Beer bottles clicking together: “Ballshank, come out and plaaaaay!”

DIVA sings:
All day long they blow so hard

Trippin’ balls out on BF Day, wearing orange on the pitcher’s mound 
Prison Guard: “Is this another double entendre?”

(Tice Dani and Some Newbi from their team, dressed in Hell Razor attire)
Tice: Well Pledge, you’ve been in the league for 6 weeks, played 4 games, bunted only twice, and were able to harmonize on key for our witches taunt.  I think you’re ready to get jumped into the gang.
Newbie: Oh, no, I mean, I’m down for being part of a shitty razor scooter gang, you know like sons of anarchy without the Hamlet metaphors, good looking actors, and shittier writing, but I got keep my face pretty.  That’s hows I makes my money.

Leif: No, no no.  You need something else. (grabs a big jug labeled ACID) How about a FACIAL?!? (dumps the acid on her head.  Dani screams, puts her hands to her face and smashes a bunch of hamburger meat onto her face)

[Serfs (with snorkles) pop out of hot tub, drop their hoes/hose, and carry ivan away on a surf board]
Bathwatch: [slowly running behind] HOOOOOOOLLLD DOOOOOOR
[snoop dog: gin and juice plays/ serfs bring out vodka shots]

Ministers of Jokes:  Velcome to beginning of kickball season, I am Berninstein Sandersvich, and I am proud to present ze first taunt of the season. Ve are bloc rocker pussy riot and for your entertainment, we have series of jokes approved by the Ministry of Humor.  These jokes and musical entertainings, are written for the people, not the one percent, the bankers, or the billionaire class.  The props are made through the collective works of peoples collectives, all of which have fabulous health care, maternity leaves and of course many potatoes for eating.  So please laugh loud or you will be shot.

Agata/Laika: Don't be fooled by the beets that I got
             I'm still, I'm still Agata from the bloc
             Used to have a little, now I have much less
             No matter where I go, I know where I came from

Background: From Poland!
(Agata hit old man bernienstein in the head with a beet.  He falls like sack of potatoes.  Much laughs.)
Baba yaga (wearing a sign saying “Baba Yaga, famous russian witch): Comrades it is I baba yaga, the famous Russian witch, get that bitch (Agata barks) off stage so we can focus on witches
1stpussyrioter:  I got this (gets huge comical micro phone) 
2ndpussyrioter: Move witch, get out the way, get out the witch get out the way.
Bernienstein:  I get knocked down, but I get up again! (gets knocked down again)
1RD Pussy rioter: 	You're a witch, you're a hiller,
Your favorite song is thriller,
You mix potions, you cast spells,
You'll probably go to hell.

You kick balls, you write taunts,
You've got some skills to flaunt,
You know we wouldn't play you any other way.
UberDriver: (can we steal a car from Luke’s taunt?) Dig through the ditches and burn through the witches and cram in the back of my UBER ride 
pussyrioter#3: Hey this uber can fit 7 people?
UberDriver: It is prius?!?
PussyRioter#3:  Yeah, so 7 people is totes cool, am I right?
UberDriver: So where do you want to go?

All pussy rioters sit in a line in front of the 3rd pussy rioter 
pussyrioter#3:  	I wanna be where the witches are
I wanna see, wanna see 'em bunting
Stumblin’ around in those
Whaddya call 'em? Oh, cleats

Stirring your legs (a la calling all the basic witches), you dn't get too far
Ankles are required for runnin’, kickin’
Conga linin’ along down the
What's that word again? Baaaaar
	Up where they drink, up where they chug
Up where they  party having fun
Wish I could be, no
Witch I could be, drunk WKL
All leg swingin’ pussy riotiers in a monotone chant.  Calling all the basic witches.  Call all the basic witches.  You’re basic.  
Pussyrioter#4: Guys what the hell is going on, this taunt is all over the place. Maybe we shouldn’t have taken all of that acid.
Pussyrioter#5: But how else would we have neutralized all of those basic witches.
Baba Yaga: 	If you’re having taunt problems I feel bad for you hun, 
I got 99 problems but a witch ain’t one! HUG ME! <mic drop> 

Fergs: Well Hello WKL,  welcome to the second week of the Season. Now when I heard that Capown’d had decided to do a Game of thrones team not only because, I’m a huge fan of the series, and finally we have a team idea from these guys that isn’t racist.  But I’m here today to express my disappointment in you guys once again.  You guys fucked it up.  You really, really fucked it up.  Anthony, Alexandra,  Jason, come on up here.   Now first off, you fucked up your name, a taunt of thrones??? What the fuck were you thinking?  The WAY better name for your team is:  A game of taunts, a song of balls and fire.  For fucks sakes.  You’re killing me here (SPOLIER ALERT) Now, let’s just look on how you royally buggered the casting of your team.  Anthony, you play Geoffery, the little shit of a king of Westeros.  Now in the series, Geoffery, marries Magery Tyrel, a woman older than him, and you wouldn’t even finger bang a woman ½ your age yet a lone marry them.  Alexdanra, you play Danerys storm born, the mother of dragon.  You guys almost got this one, but Alexandra is the mother of a number of herpes which also burn, but are far less deadly.  And last but not least on the numerous ways you have fucked up your kickball season we have Jason.  Jason, you are Vayrs, the master of spies and, notably, an effeminate eunuch.      Now, you may be a little light in the loafers, but from what I;ve heard from the guys who work at The white Swallow, steam works, or any of Seattle’s many “gentlemen’s bath houses” this guys scrotum, and rectum, hang to his knees.   Ok, ok, Now instead of taunting you, which I think would be a waste of time, because you’ve already fucked this up so much.  We’re going  to play MUSICAL THRONES,  a game where you win, or you get wasted.  Ok, you’re going to get wasted anyway.

(Basically we make them walk around a series of thrones,, until the music stops, then they sit on a throne, but each throne has a consequence.)
 The throne of the French (a throne covered in baguettes) – the person who chooses this throne has to do the croissant shot.  The joke is that when we bring them the croissant shot, there are actually 13 shots, a bakers.
The Throne of the North A toilet filled with ice, that the person has to sit in and drink a pint of peppermint schnapps  before they can stand up.  Someone sits on them saying HORDOR until they finish the bottle
The Thrones of Dildos Sit uncomfortably or maybe VERY comfortably in the Throne of dildos, taking a few blow job shots to the face.
The Iron Throne You must beer bong wine until your team members can name (either the 7 kingdoms of Westoros or 7 Iron and Wine song titles)   


(SCENE: FERGUSON holding a triform. FLOWER PEOPLE walk up and grab the sides.)
FLOWER PEOPLE (SINGING): Little shop! Little shop of horrors!
(FLOWER PEOPLE unfold triform, revealing vagina with Andy’s face.)
FERGUSON: Feed me semen! Feed me!
 (Record scratch. COLLEEN runs on stage, grabs the triform and throws it away.)
COLLEEN: No no guys, I’m sorry but this won’t work. Booze Scouts already did this lame idea. I’ve got an idea for a way better musical.
(Backdrop unveils: “THE SOUND OF WHORROR”)
COLLEEN: The whores are alive with the sound of cumming

WOMEN: (Women moan) The job they have done for a thousand years, The cock fills my cunt with the sound of cumming

MEN: (Men moan) My mouth wants to blow every cock it nears

(Enter NAPOLEON.)

NAPOLEON: Your socks are too short, you silly Austrian person!

(NAPOLEON cuts off COLLEEN’S HEAD)

EVERYONE: Quelle horreur, quelle horreur!

(Exit NAPOLEON and COLLEEN, enter AGATA, THING 1, and THING 2)

AGATA: Comedrops on titties and whiskers on pussies
Tight moistened sphincters on warm virgin tushies
Discrete paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

When the slave bites
Then the whip stings
When I’m feeling bad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don’t feel so sad

(Enter NAPOLEON)

NAPOLEON: Your Ed Hardy tattoos are not douchey enough!

(NAPOLEON CUTS OFF AGATA’S HEAD)

(Exit NAPOLEON and AGATA. Enter JEFF, JONATHAN, and THE ANALWEISS CHORUS)

(JEFF BENDS OVER WITH JONATHAN BEHIND HIM WHILE HE STARTS SINGING)

JEFF: Analweiss, analweiss

(JONATHAN STARTS FUCKING JEFF UP THE ASS)

JEFF: (switches to falsetto, at least for a bit): Every morning you greet me
Big and black
Thick and stacked
You look happy to meet me
My rubber bro may you bloom and grow
Bloom and grow forever
Analweiss Analweiss
Bless my backdoor forever

(Enter NAPOLEON)

 NAPOLEON: Fuck fuck fuck Cute Cute Cute!

(Massacre ensues.)

(Exeunt NAPOLEON and THE ANALWEISS CHORUS.)

(Enter LEIF and CHRISTINE. LEIF sits down on a stage while CHRISTINE gives him a lap dance.)

LEIF: YOU ARE SIXTEEN GOING ON SEVENTEEN
BABY IT’S TIME  TO THINK
BETTER BEWARE, BE CANNY AND CAREFUL
BABY YOU’RE ON THE BRINK

(Enter NAPOLEON)

NAPOLEON: Too soon! We’re not taunting Monaco until Thursday!

(NAPOLEON kills LEIF and CHRISTINE.)

(ENTER EVERYONE. CURTAIN CALL WITH REPRISE.)

EVERYONE: The whores are alive with The French Connexxxion!

(Ends with someone crossing the stage with a sign that says “APPLAUSE”.)

(BEAVERTRADERS#1+#2 enter scene. One of them is holding a map.)
BEAVERTRADER#1: At last, we have arrived on scenic Punani Wu! On this map, it says “HERE THERE BE BEAVERS.” Which, as French beaver traders, is exactly what we need! But it’s written in English! Which as French beaver traders, is very confusing!
BEAVERTRADER#2: Zees island is supposed to be covered in beaver! I have heard that the beaver runs so thick that the ground is like one giant 1970’s bush!
TRADER#1: Yes, and then we can take all zee island beaver back to France and sell it on the street at outrageous prices!
TRADERS: (French laughter, you know, “hon hon hon hon hon”) 
(The two look around the island)
 (Enter LUKE, clapping two coconuts, enter luke wearing a Hawaiian shirt and no pants.  Hot dog wang a flyin’)
LUKE: Hello there!
TRADER#1: Zut alors! An indigenous person!
TRADER#2: We must subjugate him at once!
(Move to attack him)
LUKE: No wait! Like you colonialist explorers, I too am white and have a penchant for exploiting island cultures! I am LUKE WALKER, captain of TEAM ZISSOU!
TRADER#2: Oh I’m sorry! Your stereotypical panPacificIslander style of dress is as convincing as it is culturally insensitive! Mais oui, we are beaver traders who have come to harvest your island’s finest beaver!
LUKE: Oh, sorry there’s no beaver here, there’s only one jack ass.  Get it?  I mean me!  But seriously, do you have any food?  There’s no food on this island.
TRADER#1: But, uh, zee map it says there would be beavers here.
LUKE: Yeah, all the Beavers died after we got here.  You see that Volcano over there, the one that looks like a snatch?  Yeah, it erupts once a month, for like 3 to 5 days.  You can always tell when it’s coming because the island gets all bitchy.  GET IT?  LIKE A WOMANS VAGINA WHEN IT MENSTRUATES. HAYOOOOOOOH!  I am so funny and clever.
TRADER#2: Zaat is how you say, predictable.  We do not find your antics amusing, and that is saying a lot, we find Jerry Lewis funny. 
LUKE: Yeah whatever, I don’t care about you, this is all about ME ME ME.   You see, I was on a Life Aquatic cruise when we ran aground here and got stranded.
TRADER#1: Yes, I think I read about that in the papers. “The Zissou Accident,” they called it. The headline in Le Monde read “Drunk Assholes Lost at Sea” for a week!
(Spinning newspaper headlines spin across stage:
#1: DRUNK ASSHOLES LOST AT SEA
#2: WARRANT SERVED FOR INTOXICATED CRUISE CAPTAIN
#3: U.S. COAST GUARD ABANDONS SEARCH FOR LOST SUBMARINE, CLAIMING “NOBODY GIVES A SHIT REALLY” 
TRADER#2: But Zissou was two years ago! What have you been doing the whole last year?
LUKE: Mostly masturbating to my taunt ideas. I mean… pornography. Masturbating to ADULT pornography.
TRADER#1: What happened to the rest of your crew? Did they drown?
LUKE: No, we couldn’t find any food here so we had to eat all the men one by one.
TRADER#2: So you had to eat your entire crew? Quelle horreur… quelle horreur!
LUKE: No, there were only a couple guys on the team, but after we ate the last one all the girls built a raft and left for Wang Island. They said something about my creepy mustache giving them eye herpes, but that doesn’t make any sense because this thing is AWESOME! You see, it curls up, and then it curls up a second time on each side, which I feel is superior to a normal moustache, and it does it all without any need for mustache wax whatsoever, which is a total chick magnet—

TRADER#2: <vomits>
TRADER#1: So have you been trapped here alone this whole time?
LUKE: No, I’ve had Wilson here to keep me company. But he got a bit… deflated after a while.
(Luke pulls out deflated kickball with eyes, a nose, and a small circle for a mouth drawn on it with a sharpie ala that other Tom Hanks movie I haven’t seen. Inside the mouth is a tiny hole due to puncturing by a tiny penis. Semen is dripping out the hole.)
TRADER#2: So you sodomized a kickball and ate human beings.
LUKE: No, after I popped off Wilson, I just started building HUGE props and costumes for my epic return to taunting.   I also came up with an elaborate team theme that NO ONE WILL UNDERSTAND!  Here, I’ve made flyers for everyone detailing every aspect of my amazing totally creative idea!  (hands out a few really long scrolls) 
TRADER#1: What first this is really racist against Polynesians, also isn’t your idea just a ripoff of a movie where Tom Hanks has a shitty mullet that lost almost 10 million Euros, it was a bigger flop zen Howard zee duck.
 
(TRADER#1 pulls off glove, slaps LUKE in face with it)
TRADER#2: The French have appropriate punishment for cannibalism, kickball intercourse, and crimes against facial hair… Madame Guillotine!
TRADER#1: Mes amis! Grab him!
(Other FRENCH CONNEXXXION players enter and restrain LUKE. One of them has a tiny guillotine. Or maybe a cigar cutter, which is apparently also called a guillotine.)
LUKE: No, what are you doing? You can’t cut that off! I use that all the time, I swear! I have sex with lots and lots of women!
(FRENCH TRADERS first cut off the ends of the mustache with the guillotine, making it into a Hitler mustache. FRENCH TRADERS then cut the wang in half with the guillotine. Then throw it into the audience. LUKE turns around and somehow squirts wine out of the crotch wound into the audience then runs away. One of the TRADERS captures the wine in a goblet and ceremoniously drinks it.)
TRADER#2: I am glad we have gotten rid of that silly American fool before we had to taunt him a second time. Let us explore this island further so we do not waste this trip.
(FRENCH CONNEXXXION players wander around, and one of them peers under the tarp)
TRADER#1: I do not know why he said there was no food on this island. I mean, there’s coconut trees all over the place, and guava, and papaya, and—
(FRENCH CONNEXXXION players tear down tarp revealing FOOD TRUCK)
PLAYER#3: hey guys, there’s a food truck over here! Run by Julia Child!
JULIA CHILD: Hellooooooo! Welcome to How Pickle Got Into a Clam! We’ve been here for like a year but we only just got the generator running! Would you like to try our unicorn crepes?

	
 (SCENE OPENS: We find our selves in the back stage of the WKL half time show, ball shankers are placing huge props in positions, the spirit of 70 kicks kids are directing the action. There are Dressing rooms stage right, the back of the theater center, and craft services etc stage left.  There is a whirl wind of action going on.  Cases being moved stage left and stage right, large props being put into place etc.)
Tricia: All right you ball shankers, I don’t want any trouble out of you today or else your going RIGHT back to jail.   No! NO! NO!  Penis mountain goes stage left and the Pussy bridge to the heavenly clit goes stage RIGHT!  Strike ONE ball shank! Can’t believe they gave us prison labor as stage hands, what cheap bastard is paying for this shit show?  All right everyone, come together. We’re 5 mins away from being LIVE on tv for the WKL half time show.  I want you all to be professional, happy, and perfect.  I expect nothing less.  Danny:
Danny: Yes tricia?
Tricia: My head set please. (danny hands her his head set, maybe we bedazzle this bitch?) PLACES PEOPLE, LET’S DO THIS PEOPLE. 
Enter Andy WHoreballs with a gaggle of Divas, Andy is taking pictures of the Divas
Andy: Oh, fabulist, beautiful, make nonconsensual sex to my lens.
Tricia: MrWhoreballs, I believe we are ready for you.
Andy: No, no no.  This is all wrong.
Madonna: Yeah, where is my didldo unicorn?
Tricia: uh, we never spoke about a dildo
Lemmy: Where is my skull that shoots snakes out of the eyes?
Tricia: Skull that?
Andy: yeah, and where is my Lady GaGa?  What the Hell Tricia?  I hired you because you are the most competent person in the whole freaking league, and you screw all this up?
Tricia: MrWhoreballs, I swear we never spoke about any of this
Andy: Of course we didn’t.  We stayed up until 3am last night writing this magum opus, instead of the garage we were going to do. Here’s the new taunt. (hands tricia a stack of papers) 
Lady GaGa: (now at the craft services table) Uh, Andy.  We have a huge problem.
Andy:  What is it my muse?
Lady: I FOUND A GODAMN GREEN M&M IN THE NO GREEN M&M BOWL
(All the diva’s freak out and go to their dressing room, during this move lady gag a gets connected to the hoist and lifted in the air)
Andy: well shit Tricia.  You better figure this out.  I’m going to use this time to get all my awkward minutes in.  (starts filming the taunt)
Tricia: Ok, christ.  Look at this thing.  (looking at the taunt) Ok, baby Kyle, SOME OTHE MEMBER OF BALL SHANK, come here. We’re going to hve to completely remake everything we’ve done for this
Baby Kyle: Ah shit.  I hate taunts.  
Other PMS member: we have to do it baby kyle.  Do you want to go back in the hole?
Baby Kyle: I want to get back in your
Tricia: NO!  Just get back to work. Danny, Rob, I need you two to go out there and entertain the crowd for like 5 minutes.  We need to buy time
Danny: Sure thing Tmoney.  How about we sing a song, like fuck the French all  night?
Tricia: No, no more old throw back jokes.  Do something from this year
Danny: yeah, but nothing we did this year was close to as good as fuck the French
Tricia: I DON’T CARE.  Just get your skinny ass out there and enterain those drunks.
Bobby: I’m here too
Tricia: WHATEVER. Just get out there and kills some time.
(enter the nerd herd)
Kevin: Tricia! Tricia, we have the solution to all your problems.  Lasers!
Tina: Lasers? Guys, this is a day time show, there’s no way the WKL is going to see lasers in day light.
Danni: Don’t worry, I’ve got an expert here, one that you might be questionably attracted too. (the lasers gag starts)
Isaac: You see, we use ultra violet light that passes through a quartz crystal
Tina: Yeah, I know how lasers
Isaac: Shh.  I’m mansplaining
Tina: Sploosh.   Come with me.
Dylan and another pirate enter
Dylan: Hey Tricia, put us on, we got a great bit, check it out.  What has 8 legs, 8 arms and eight eyes?
Pirate#2: I don’t know Dyelon?
Dylan: 8 pirates!  Waka waka waka
(hook grabs them and pull them off)
Tricia: Christ (checks watch) 4 minutes until we’re live
Danny (sticks head out of the curtain, possibly covered in blood) Tricia, We’re getting killed up here.  We need some help.
Andy Whoreballs:  Trica, darling, I need to speak to Ga Ga about the third act.  Have you seen her?
Gaga: I’m up here.  Help.  I’m stuck
Tricia: No I haven’t seen her.  


(SCENE OPENS: Tina walks into the scene where Tricia, Danny, Danielle and Emily are standing next to the score board, our current team placards are up.  Danny is using a guitar as a crutch, Danielle has a boot on..  Our current teams are on the score board. )
Tina:  	Hey 76’ers!  How many of us are going to actually play against D.I.V.A today?
Danny:	Oh man, It’s just Trisha and 6 “ringers” out there.  We don’t even have a full team. We’re going to get slaughtered. 
Daniel: Yeah, wish we could play, I mean, Danny got hit by a car last weekend, so he’s obviously out.  And me, my leg gets mysteriously injured for 10 weeks every year right around kickball, so I’ve been out this entire season, again.  Bummer.
Emily: It’s really weird how it happens every season.  Hey, I got champers! 
Danielle:(jumps up runs over to her) Ooo!  I want some!
Emily: Like I said, really weird.  (pours some champers)
Tricia: Damnit you guys, I’m going to be out there for EVERY INNING, and I’m a freaking mom! Emily why aren’t you playing?
Emily: Taking care of the wounded. D’uh
Tina: What are we doing for the taunt?
Danny: Well, we’re going to sing a super awesome song.  Ah one two three (sings) D. I. V. A. it fun to play against DIVA
Tricia: Ug, I’m OVER IT.  We’re doing a song for the taunt?  REALLY? We’re going there AGAIN? No story? No Setup? No costumes? Aren’t we more creative than that?  What does it mean to be the SPIRIT of seventy kicks? 
Enter the spirit of 76’s
Spirit of 76: Behold, it’s I, the spirit of 70 kicks.  
Tricia, Danny, Danielle, Emily, Tricia: Wilkers!
Spirit of 76:  I’ve come here today to teach you of the true spirit of the WKL!
Tricia: Whiskey?
Spirit of 76: No no no, the other one.  I am going to take you to your past team, your present team, and YOUR TEAM OF THE FUTRE.  I’ll show you where you lost your spirit!
Danny: Wait, is this a Christmas carol taunt?  Didn’t you guys try to do a Christmas taunt last week?
Spirit of 76: did we really try?  
Danny: fair point.  Well, let’s get this over with, just take me, I’ll tell them the story when I get back. I tell the best stories. (does the Wayne’s world doodly doos)
Spirit of 76: No, bad Danny! We’re not doing that, it’s lame. I summon the ghost of WKL PAST!! (SMOKE takes off one table cloth to reveal a black/pirate themed table cloth.  Score board changes to Pirates vs Monster squad All the other 76’s change quickly into pirate costumes, drinking and having a good time)
Danny: When are we
Spirit of 76: We’re back  in 2009!
Danny: Oh wow, the last year we were the pirates.  Look, we were having so much fun!  
Spirit of 76: Yes, yes you were!  You all were the life of the party!  Dancing on the bar at the buckaroo, getting shit faced every single night, wearing the same godaman costumes you had worn for the last 7 years.
Danny: Look at Emily, she was only 17 but we got her in that bar every night.  
Spirit: For reals?  Look  with your whole eyeballs Danny, what else do you see?  
Danny: I see the rest of the WKL is here too!  Look, Luke’s in his teen wolf costume.  Fergy here and he weighs 50lbs less!  Holy shit, there’s the freaking NUDGEE!
Spirit: Are you starting to get what made your team so spirited?
Danny: Not. at. all.
Spirit: Then we must go to the present. (pulls off the pirate table cloth to reveal the American table cloth)
Danny: No no no.  We’ve already done the present and it sucks.  this taunt is already long so let’s just skip to the end.
Spirit: FINE! To the future we go. (pulls off the American table cloth to reveal the final one, team names are now Split pee and Hambone: A soup themed team, and Soft Taco Penis quiet {maybe make this better} sprit of 76 kick are now super old)
Danny Wowzers, look at all the flying cars! 
Spirit; We still call those airplanes Danny.  It’s only 2030.  Look, there’s you team.
Danny: Holy shit.  We’ve aged TERRIBLY. 
Spirit: Yes, all the drinking, and being in the sun by the score board has turned your already aged bodies in to old leathery skin bags.
Tina: Tricia, sure is nice that Hamish joined our team.
Tricia: Yeah, ever since the accident turned him into a mutant cyborg, he just the best kickball player.
Tina; I know! He can play all the positions at once with his crazy cyborg speed, so we have to do is here by the score board all game long.
Danielle: Let’s be honest, it’s the only thing we’ve enjoyed for years.  Look over at the bleachers, bunch a new kids, having fun, chanting, tking off their clothes, GET OFF MY LAWN….  We’re far too old and lame for the.  Yup.  Score board is where it’s at.
Danny: Wait, wait! Spirit!  I’ve figured it out! I KNOW WHAT WE’VE DONE TO LOSE OUR SPIRIT!  Take me back!  Take me back to our time.
Spirit: I can’t, I already threw away the now time table cloth
Danny: Fine, I’ll just do it myself(does the waynes world doodbly doos,  score board changes to current day, team changes to current day, 76sers turn into today)  Guys! I know how we’ve lost our spirit. We all just hang out here in front of the score board during every game, blocking the view for everyone! The entire rest of the league is hanging out there, bleachering, meeting new people! We don’t hang out with anyone new, hell we even turn down rookies before the season starts, and now we can’t even field a team now! If we mix it up, and get out there and meet the league, they’ll all remember how awesome we are!  Guys we don’t need crutches or air casts, we need our booze, drugs and fun.  So let’s abandon this score board forever and stick our spirit right back into the WKL.  Who is with me?
all 76ers:  (bunch of cheers)
Danny: DICKS OUT KIDS!

 (SCENE OPENS: Bunch of Dino’s sitting around a Christmas tree. Jasmin passes Scottie a large present.)
JASMIN:	And this big package is for Scottie!
SCOTTIE:	I’ve always wanted a big package! Is it from Mama?
JASMIN:	No, not the mama. It must be a secret admirer.
EVERYONE:	Ooooooooooooooooohhhh!!!!!
(SCOTTIE opens up the present to reveal a giant egg.)
SCOTTIE:	It’s… a giant egg.
STICKNEY:	Is it Faberge?
SCOTTIE:	Noooooooo.
AFTON:	Is it an everlasting cock sucker from Bling it Onka’s Taunt Factory?
SCOTTIE:	Noooooooooo!
(Egg cracks open revealing baby Diva the Dinosaur [Hamish’s hand puppet dinosaur].)
SOUNDFX:	Cracking sound.
AFTON:	Ooooh, a baby Dinosaur, it’s so cute. Let’s name her DeeDee!
(Afton plays with Diva, who bites off her finger. She screams and blood squirts everywhere, DIVAs enter to sing.

CHORUS: 	DeeDee, the last dinosaur
		She’s my friend and a whole lot more.
		DeeDee, the last dinosaur
		She ate my finger and now I’m sore.

(Sign saying “time passes”. Diva and Scottie enter stage. Diva is older now [actually a larger dog in one of Hamish’s dinosaur costumes])
SCOTTIE:	(Looking around to make sure the coast is clear). Hey Dee Dee, do you want some peanut butter? 
(Scottie pulls out hot dog dick from pants as if he is going to smear peanut butter on it to have Diva fellate him. Diva immediate eats hot dog [as dogs will]. Scottie screams and blood squirts everywhere.)

CHORUS:	DEEDEE the last Dinosaur, 
		she’ll eat your dick and a whole lot more.
(Sign saying “time passes” Dino’s are on stage and adult Diva enters [one of us in the dinosaur onesie]. She is eating some bloody meat or something).

DIVA:		Hey gang, you wanted to see me?
AFTON:	Yeah, we need to talk. Please, sit down.
DIVA:		What’s this about? Is this a fucking intervention? 
JASMIN:	DeeDee, your primordial urges are seriously becoming a problem. You need to be a more evolved being.
DIVA:		But this is who I am! 
STICKNEY:	You have to be better than your basic instincts.
 
SCOTTIE:	You’ve been hanging around with a real Paleopathetic crowd. And this dino culture that you’re promoting is causing real dino damage. Not just to us, your family, but for the entire community.
MAMA:	We need you to be the kind of dinosaur who if you see something, you say something. Not the dinosaur who does something. If you do something, we want you to say something, before we see something. You see what I’m saying?
SCOTTIE:	And if you see something on the field, and you record it, you should upload it right away. Like before you leave the field, it’s super easy, there’s no reason not to.
DIVA:		So wait. If I see something, I should say something, and then do something? I’m confused.
MAMA:	DeeDee, we just want what’s best for you.
DIVA:		I think I know what the root cause of my problem is. You see with these tiny arms I can’t pleasure myself, so I take it out on my friends. And strangers. And puppies. And puppy strangers. And I’d really like to take it out on this one crazy neighbor…
AFTON:	No Diva, this isn’t how we raised you. Which is why we are sending you away for human conversion therapy.
DIVA:		But I’m not a human, I’m a dinosaur, I was born this way.
CHORUS: 	I was boooorn this way! (Lady Gaga style)
SCOTTIE:	No, there is a human at your dinocore. Just look in a mirror!
JASMIN:	Mirror!? We doing lines?
CHORUS:	White Lines! (Grandmaster Flash style)
STICKNEY:	It’s a metaphor, Jasmin. 
(Diva goes crazy, killing all the dinos, lots of blood and body parts).
DIVA:		You don’t gnome me. (slaps gnome hat off someone)
		I don’t want to go to rehab. 
CHORUS:	Nooo, Nooo, No (Amy Whinehouse Style)
DIVA:		This is who I am! This is how I express myself!
CHORUS:	Express yourself! (Madonna style)
DIVA:		I’m changing my look, I’m changing my name 
and I’m hittin’ the road jack. 
CHORUS:	Hit the road jack. (Paul Simon Style. Gets cut off by Diva.)
DIVA:			I AM a more evolved dinosaur, I’m a divasaur!
		From now on, call me DIVA.
 (While Diva is still ripping people apart a bunch of D.I.V.A.’s sing the song)
CHORUS: 		diva, the first divasaur, 
			she's evolved into a whole lot more, 
			diva the first divasaur,
			she's a little glam, and a whole lotta gore!

SONG CUE:	Born this way. 
(Diva and D.I.V.As dance around the dead dinos.)
(END)

(Open to see large phone and Durst. Most of taunt is just Durst hanging out at home, walking around doing chores, etc. while responding to messages that come up on the phone. )


Durst: hmm… Someone’s messaging me. Looks like the team. I’ll just post this little emoji of myself. Taunt planning? I'm out!
[Leaves group, gets added back in]
What? I thought I left the group chat. Oh, thanks a LOT Miles. Whatever…I guess I could maybe go have a drink… Wonder what time they’re getting together. Oh, 7, that’s like right now.
I wonder who we’re taunting… Is it the Divas? The Divas… are… poop. I'm out.
[Leaves group, gets added back in]
Ashley, do you really think we can do a song and dance routine against the Divas?
Really Kevin? A fight scene? That’s exactly what we did against them last year. 
The divas are attacked by queen bees and ant queens in the forest? Spencer you’re so weird. Sounds like a DinoCore taunt.
Facial? YEAH Ashley, that’s hilarious. Divas LOVE getting facials.
Fisting? No, that's just gross.
Gangsta rap Kevin? We just did that on Saturday.
Marry, Boff, Kill. Oh Spencer, when will you learn?
What is this some kind of Game of Thrones idea, Spencer? That's been done to death. Don’t they know there was a whole team dedicated to that a few years ago? I mean bringing that back would just be taunt suicide. 
Oh man looks like everyone is getting a little too dramatic for me. “Seriously guys, I told you, I’m not in the League anymore.”
[Leaves group, gets added back in]
Dang, Spencer is getting pissed. He must be upset that no one likes his ideas. Yeah spencer, smoke some trees, chill out dude. Screw this
[Leaves group, gets added back in]
GRRRRRR!!!
[Leaves group, gets added back in]
Miiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiles
[KNOCK AT THE DOOR]
SPENCER: What the HELL MAN?!! You don’t like any of my ideas, nobody likes any of my ideas, I just feel like I’m not a functional part of this team… 
[Spencer tried to hurt Durst. Christine comes in to interrupt]
CHRISTINE: “Emojis may be fun, but they don’t convey the true depth of feeling available in the English language. There’s too much misunderstanding in today’s society, we need to come together in the same room 
Someone in crowd: (THAT’S WHAT SHE SAID!)
CHRISTINE: hey! in actual real rooms using actual goddamned words. Otherwise, people’s feelings get hurt. Seriously, emojis are a problem harming innocent people all over the world today. Remember, use your words, kids. Use your goddamned words.”

HEATHER:	To the pundergnome with you!
(While chanting, GNOMES lead DIVAS into the PUNDERGNOME. Somehow, this ends with LEMMY holding HAMISH standing right behind GAGA)
GNOMES:	Two gnomes enter! No gnomes leave! Two gnomes enter! No gnomes leave!
HEATHER:	For challenging my gnomethority, you must fight our greatest warrior, which is me, in the greatest challenge gnome to known… I mean, known to gnome… THE PANTS ON—

(HAMISH dances. It’s super fucking cute. While he’s dancing, GAGA and grabs all of the gnomes and get them to dance with them.)
HEATHER AND LUKE:	Gnooooooooooome, we lost our army of gnomes! 
GAGA:		No, there’s a better way! With fewer puns, and shorter taunts! Well, maybe shorter taunts? Not necessarily this one! And awesome song and dance routines!
(HEATHER and LUKE start dancing with everyone else.)
LUKE:		You’re right! Singing and dancing is way more fun than just doing shitty puns. As thanks, I give you the greatest weapon in the gnome world… THE ROSETTA’S GNOME!
LUKE hands LEMMY the scroll. Lemmy unrolls it.
LEMMY:	Uh, this is, just a bunch of gnome puns and the last one is I like the way you work it?

Person#2: A joke from last year, rewritten, but just barely.  

Person#1: (carrying a badly drawn sign) FACT, I am carrying a badly drawn sign that you cannot read because it is drawn badly AND I keep moving it around. 

Person#7:  I’m wearing something that is making you laugh because of how it reveals my body in an awkward fashion. I am also saying my lines much too quiet for everyone to hear, especially if you happen to be laughing. 

(Person 1 presents Cardboard sign: “4 agonizing minutes later” then leaves stage)

Person#7: I’ve never been in a taunt before, we didn’t really get a lot of time to practice and I don’t really understand what’s going on. However, I’m going to deliver these lines the best I can and the people who watch it online at work tomorrow will not be able to hear what I’m saying.  My lines are extremely integral to the taunt and much too wordy for anyone to follow. 

Person#2: This is the part where we setup what is about to happen.  penis.

NeighborLady: I am complaining about everything that you love about the WKL. 

Person#2: Knowing look to the audience, long pause, shrugs shoulders. I guess this means it’s time for a song. No taunt could win without one.

EVERYONE, person#2 starts: (to the tune of Bear Necessities) 
We taunted, juuuust Bearly, 
we taunted just by recipe, 
forget about the thinking and the fights
I mean taunt just Bearly,

CAPTAIN:	Captain’s log, stardate something something 69 dude. The U.S.S. InHerThighs has been on a seemingly endless exploratory mission in the Bleachers quadrant.  After all this time floating alone in space the crew is getting understandably antsy. With this mission coming to a close I too am ready for some shore leave and a little R&R.
TREKKIE#1:	Captain, we are approaching starbase Deep Throat Nine. I’m making the Final Penetration now.

TREKKIE#1:	We’ve docked, captain.
CAPTAIN:	Bridge to the transporter room, 3 to beam down to the station.

(ENTER PREDATOR)
ALISSA:	Oh, he’s mine.
PREDATOR:	You know, I’m not sure if she’ll be able to handle my 4 foot long barbed corkscrew cock. 
ALISSA:	Don’t worry, my box is much bigger on the inside.

CAPTAIN:	No, this isn’t right, we’ve been sent here by the Federation to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new fucks and new inebriations. To cum where no man, or woman, has ever cum before. We are the crew of the U.S.S. InHerThighs and we WILL live up to our founding principles. Now give me some of that sweet space juice!

WIL:		Hi, I’m TV’s Wil Wheaton, you might know me as Wesley Crusher from Star Trek: The Next Generation, or from my performance as Wil Wheaton on The Big Bang Theory. Now speaking of big banging, today I want to talk to you about a serious problem plaguing the galaxy: space herpes.
TREKKIES (in background):	OH GOD I’VE GOT SPACE HERPES! (proceed to freak the fuck out and run around quietly screaming)
WIL:		Like many of you in the audience, I too have acquired space herpes after an intimate encounter with a sextraterrestrial. I try to be careful, but outbreaks can occur at any time.
CAPTAIN (in background):	MY PENIS JUST FELL OFF!
WIL:		That’s why I take the only medicine proven to reduce the risk of spreading space herpes. (HOLDS UP CUP) ValTrek. Taken once daily, or four times each on Wednesdays and Thursdays, it can help protect my partner… and maybe keep my penis from falling off.
CAPTAIN and TREKKIE tackle WIL and start doing shots of ValTrek.

HEIDI:			I feel beautiful! You’re amazing! OH MY GOD everyone, let’s all hug!
PERSON#3: 		(HUGGING PERSON 2) You’re my best friend!
PERSON#2: 		and you’re mine!
PERSON#6: 		You guys, I think we need a BIG group hug to help save the world!
PERSON#4: 		Yeah, let’s do it! Stand up everyone, we’re here to save you!
(everyone lines up next to each other and walks toward the audience to give a big group hug. Cookies and jello shots are given out)

 (END)

(ENTER NUMBER ONE. They walk back and forth and do exposition.)
CAPTAIN:	Number One, you’re running late. Were you at a slumber party?
NUMBER ONE:	I was under the impression it was casual Friday. 
(CAPTAIN and NUMBER ONE both look at Fergie. Pregnant pause.) 
FERGIE:	What?
NUMBER ON:	But seriously, I was dealing with number two…
CAPTAIN:	Lieutenant Commander Data?
NUMBER ONE:	Data, sir?
CAPTAIN:	Yes, you see if you and I were incapacitated he would be in command of the ship.
NUMBER ONE:	Oh, not that number two.
CAPTAIN:	Ah, clever number one!  You were referring to feces. If I remember my 21st century history classes correctly, that sort of vocabulary may come in quite handy in our next mission. 
NUMBER ONE:	Sir?
CAPTAIN:	You see we’ve been tasked by Starfleet Command on a mission into human history critical to preserving the existence of the Federation itself.
NUMBER ONE:	But doesn’t time travel violate the Prime Directive, sir? And what does this have to do with doodoo?
CAPTAIN:	Section 31 has suspended the prime directive and all Starfleet regulations for this mission, so anything goes! WOOOOOOOOO! 
(THEY HIGH FIVE)
NUMBER ONE:	Does that include don’t ask, don’t tell?
(CAPTAIN and NUMBER ONE stare at each other awkwardly. Pregnant pause.) 
CAPTAIN:	The important part is that we must travel back in time to the summer of 2015 on a mission that could, I repeat, alter the very course of human history.
NUMBER ONE:	2015?!? That’s just one year before… the incident! Are we leaping back in time so that we can strive to put right what once went wrong?!
CAPTAIN:	No, no, no. We’re just going on a beer run. Rear Admiral B’ahymen just finished off the last case of Rainier, and since the Free Cascadian Beer Wars the replicators can only make triple hopped black IPA. But before we go back in time, we must familiarize ourselves with the culture of the era.
NUMBER ONE:	Oh, hence
CAPTAIN:	Yes, they referred to their feces as number two. And just wait til you find out what they called Number One.
NUMBER ONE:	I’m sure it was appropriately awesome.  We should go to the holodeck and study
CAPTAIN:	You know, I hate the holodeck, every time I use the damn thing it is literally covered in semen. Have you ever been in there after Commander Worf?!?  Their blood’s not the only thing that’s pink and smells like fish, and he shoots 2 gallons of the stuff EVERY TIME.
NUMBER ONE:	So… You want me to close the holodeck and turn it into a cargo bay?
CAPTAIN:	No, then I couldn’t run my Orion slave girl simulation.  Anyway let’s jump into the jizz sock, program it to 2015, Fremont, Washington and see what happens.
(Other characters move off stage.)
NUMBER ONE:	Computer. Browse your wildly accurate cultural database and play the most popular piece of music from earth in the year 2015
(Song number ensues.)

(ENTER Camp counselors BLAH BLAH)
CampCounselor#1: 	Hey campers!  How’s everyone doing today?  Good?  Well that’s just swell, or, with this heat, should I say… sweltering! I mean, you gotta remember to keep your cool in this summer heat. No reason to get a hot head.  No need to freak out and have big blow out and then quit the league, er, camp.   
CampCounselor#2:	Well what better way to do that than to get all WET with a fun day packed with water sports! That’s right, today is the day when Camp Trek challenges our old friends at Camp WHAK to a series of watery competitions. The winner of today’s event earns BRAGGING RIGHTS FOR THE WHOLE SUMMER.  Yeah,  lemme hear ya CAMPERS!
(All campers and crowd cheer)
CampCounselor#1: 	Ok, here at Camp Trek we’ve picked our bridge team, we have REDSHIRT! and blue shirt! We’ll need 2 “champions” from Camp WHAK.
(Trekkies grab one planted WHAKER from the audience and brings them up.) 
CampCounselor#1:	Oh jeez, looks like we only have one WHAKER who wants to get wet, we’ll need more WHAKERS if this is going to come out right. But don’t worry, we’ve planned for such an eventuality and brought a ringer for you. And  I know how much you guys love ringers. BRING OUT THE GIMP
(Out comes the gimp) 
CampCounselor#2:	Alright first up we’ll test your accuracy with Golden Showers! <Camp Counselor 1> will go fill up some Golden Water guns for you, it’s time for a classic American challenge, the DUEL!
(Counselor 1 goes behind the bush and fake pees to fill up the guns.)
CampCounselor#2:	Okay, now walk 10 paces and turn to blow your load, but remember: don’t aim for the face or you will be disqualified. 
(Counselor 1 hands guns to gimp and blue shirt, they start walking their paces but gimp immediately gets on his knees and shoots himself in the face)
CampCounselor#2: 	Oh no, Gimpy has WHAKED himself. Well it looks like Camp Trek wins this one. Next up is our Water Sports endurance challenge: THE SLIP N SLIDE RELAY RACE.
(Counselor 1 reveals the slip and slide.) 
CampCounselor#2:	Now this one is really simple campers, your team starts at this end of the slip and slide, you run, you jump, you slide, you hit the bump AND YOU TAKE A RIDE!!  Then, you get up and slide back to your partner, and they do the same thing!  <Camp Counselor 1> can you get the course ready?
CampCounselor#1:	Sure thing!
(Counselor fake pees all over the slip and slide. REDSHIRT and WHAKER go to one end.)
Camp Counselor#2:	Okay challengers, on your mark, get set, go.
(WHAKER jumps on first, and wades around on slip and slide, slashing and sliding around.)
Redshirt:	I’ll use the transporter!
(REDSHIRT cheats by “using the transporter” one trekkie starts at the end of the slip n slide, a transporter noise, then a trekkie in the same color uniform appears on the other side of the slip n slide, they do this twice and win).
Campcounselor#2:	WOW!  Another game won by Camp Trek!  Now campers here comes the final game of finesse, and this one is for all the marbles: the water balloon toss.  Campers, stand three paces apart, and you’ll toss your water balloon to your partner, and whichever team is the farthest apart when their balloon breaks WINS.  <CampCounselor#1> can you prepare us some balloons?
(CampCounselor#1 still behind the bush whips out 2 balloons)
Campcounselor#1:	Way ahead of ya!
(Gimp grabs the balloons and immediately breaks it on himself)
CampCounselorr#2:  	Oh drat, we’re going to need more balloons.  CampCounselor#1 can you fill any more?
CampCounselor#1:	Sorry campers, I’m totally drained.
(Gimp takes off mask)
Gimp: 	Ah fuck I need more water! Do you know how hot it is in this mask?
CampCounselor1: 	Don’t worry Gimpy I filled up a whole cooler full of Wet Cold American PISS to make sure we had enough to cool EVERYONE down!
(CampCounselor#1 acts like we are going to pelt the audience, pulls out a cooler from the bush opens the lid and pulls out a Rainer)
CampCounselor1:	Who wants a refreshing Rainer!?
(Pass out Rainers to EVERYONE)

Opening: 
(ENTER ABBY and ELMO)
ABBY:		Hey, Elmo! 
ELMO:		Hi, Abby! Why don’t you tell me a joke?
ABBY:	So my friend walked into a doctors office with a carrot in his ear and a piece of celery up his nose. The doctor told him he wasn't eating right.
ABBY & ELMO:	HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
ABBY:		Now Elmo, don’t forget to tell our friends out there what the letter of the day is!
ELMO:	Thanks, Abby! Today’s episode of SKEET STREET was brought to you by the letter M, for Murder!
ELMO:	Tickle, tickle, tickle! (grabs knife and stabs PUPPET 1, then does the ELMO LAUGH)
ABBY:	(horrible death sounds)	
ALL IN BLACK METAL VOICE:	Sunny Day
Sweepin' the clouds away
On my way to where the air is sweet
Can you tell me how to get,
How to get to Skeeeeeet Street?
 (SIGN: NIGHTMARE ON SKEET STREET slowly raises to top of stage, where it stays)
(EXIT ELMO)
(ENTER ERNIE, in bath tub with soap bubbles and a dildo attached to it)
ERNIE:	Here I am in my tubby again! It’s all filled with water and nice suds… and I’ve got a big fluffy towel to wipe myself down when I’m done! But there’s one other thing that makes tubby time the very best time of the whole day! And you know what that is? It’s my very favorite little pal… I mean BIG PAL…
(Ernie picks up giant dildo and starts playing with it all sexylike.
SONG:
Rubber dickie, you’re the one!
You make bathtime lots of fun!
Rubber dickie, I’m awfully fond of you… OOOOOooOOOOO!

(ENTER ELMO with knife who murders ERNIE)
ELMO:		TICKLE, TICKLE, TICKLE!
(EXIT ELMO)
(ENTER COOKIE MONSTER)
COOKIE MONSTER:	P is for pussy, and that’s good enough—
(ELMO comes back and murders COOKIE MONSTER)
ELMO:	(laughs. softly.)
 (ENTER COUNT with a picture of MONACO on his eye. As he counts, other puppets come on and start having sex with him and each other)
COUNT:		Greetings! It is I, the Count!
PUPPET#2:	Hey Count, what’s that on your neck?
COUNT:		It’s my Monaco Monicle! (COUNT turns to the audience and stares at them straightfaced)
And it’s time to answer that fascinating question… what is the Skeet Street number of the day, ah ah! Let’s count fucks and find out!
(PUPPET#2 comes up and starts blowing COUNT)
COUNT:		THAT’S ONE! ONE FUCK! 
(PUPPET#3 comes up and starts fucking PUPPET 2 from behind)
COUNT:		TWO! TWO FUCKS! 
(PUPPET#4 comes up and gets in on the DP action with PUPPET 2)
COUNT:		THREE! THREE FABULOUS FUCKS! AH, AH, AH!
COUNT:	What? Nothing? Nothing happened! Isn’t three the number of fucks of the day? But I don’t have any more fucks to give! Where’s the confetti?
(ENTER ELMO)
ELMO:		I’ll give you confetti!
 (ELMO murders everyone. Puppet guts (cotton, yarn, pipe cleaner, googly eyes) flies out from behind the stage while people scream bloody murder.)
(ENTER FERGIE on real stage.)
FERGIE:		So guys… when is the holodeck getting fixed? This show sucks!
(All PUPPETEERS stand wearing Star Trek uniforms and shrugging.)
JONATHAN:	DAMMIT FERGIE, I’M A DOCTOR OF NEUROSCIENCE NOT A PUPPETEER!

(FIN)


JUDGE#1:	Welcome to downtown Tokyo, where Cirque du So Lame is continuing their Pacific Rim tour! Today, before we start the show, we’d like you to see the open auditions for our new stage magician!
	(SOUNDFX: THE FINAL COUNTDOWN on flute)
JUDGE#2:	The contestant will go head to head with our magician, SAMWELL THE SPECTACULAR SPELLBINDER.	
	(SAMWELL and NINJA enter)
SAMWELL: 	I am SAMWELL THE SPECTACULAR! Master of illusion!
NINJA:		I’m ERIN WILLIAMS, an international ninja of leisiure. It might surprise some of you to see a ninja auditioning to be a stage magician, but the skill set is surprisingly similar. The life of a ninja is a lonely one, and I’ve always wanted to be part of a circle of interesting people with basic cultural sensitivity.
JUDGE#1:	For the first contest, we thought we’d go with something from the basic magician’s playbook: cutting a woman in half! First up, Samwell the spectacular will show us how it’s done!
SAMWELL:	Right this way Alissa, please make your way up onto the table and gather your courage as you are about to be cut in half! 
	(SAMWELL leads out ALISSA, lies her back on a table, pulls out a saw, saws her in half—SOUNDFX: SAW—then pulls off notthatsneakilysubstituted mannequin legs and shows that they’re cut off, then reattaches them and she leaves the stage carrying the mannequin legs.)
SAMWELL (during):	I say West Coast, you will say… CHOP IN HALF!
JUDGE#2:	And now, let’s see the ninja chop a woman in half! Miss Kelly has graciously volunteered for this trick.
	(KELLY COMES ON STAGE. Before Kelly can even lie down on the table, the NINJA swings her sword around and slices her between the legs.)
NINJA & KELLY:	(SCREAMING BACK & FORTH)
KELLY:	Oh… is it the 26th already? Never mind, I just need a tampon.
	(KELLY exits.)
JUDGE#1:	Okay… I don’t think the ninja really got the point of that round.
JUDGE#2:	But KELLY sure did! For the next trick, we’ve asked the contestants to perform some slight of hand!
SAMWELL:	It’s not a trick, it’s an illusion! Tricks are what whores do for money… OR CANDY!
	(SAMWELL reaches up into armpits, pulls candy and joints from a secret stash, and throws it into audience.)
NINJA: 	Yeah, that’s what whores do for money… OR CANDY!
	(NINJA throws origami ninja stars and fake plastic knives into audience. DANI holds a plastic knife or shuriken up to her eye and pops a blood pack on it and jumps up while blood sprays out.)
DANI:	AHHHH MY EYE
NINJA and DANI: (SCREAMING BACK AND FORTH)
DANI dies.
JUDGE#1:	No, ninja, no ninja NO! Stop hurting people!
JUDGE#2:	Alright, for the next round, something that can’t possibly result in maiming… pulling a dollar out of thin air! 
JUDGE#1:	Don’t you mean a quarter?
JUDGE#2 (shrugs shoulders):		Eh, inflation.
	(CHRIS stands up, and SAMWELL pulls a dollar out of his ear.)
SAMWELL:	Sir, please stand up. (motioning to Chris) Hold on just a second, you’ve got something there… why, I found a dollar in your ear! Finally, I’m getting paid for this crap! 
	(NINJA walks up, cuts off CHRIS’s ear, pulls a quarter out of the ear stump.)
NINJA (identical cheerful delivery):	Sir you must be a gold mine! I too have found a dollar in your ear!
NINJA and CHRIS:	(SCREAMING BACK AND FORTH)
JUDGE#1:	Ninja! The purpose of a circus is to delight and amaze, not dismember!
NINJA:		You are right… I have brought dishonor to myself, my lord and my family. I must commit… honorable seppuku.
JUDGE 1 (runs up to NINJA):	No, you have so much left to live for!
	(NINJA pulls out sword and accidentally stabs JUDGE 1 who dies screaming)
NINJA:		Oops!
JUDGE 2 (running up):	No, stop! Bad ninja! Bad ninja!
	(NINJA turns around to look at JUDGE 2 and accidentally stabs JUDGE 2 who dies screaming)
	(NINJA pulls at collar and makes three stooges sound.)
	(NINJA then tries to stab himself in the stomach, misses and kills SAMWELL.)
SAMWELL:	I will never reveal my secrets. (dies)
NINJA:		Oh no, not again! I thought we had such a good connection going there… now I’ll NEVER have an orgy in a circus tent! I guess it’s back to me and Steen on the boat again this weekend.
	(NINJA throws down smoke bomb.)
NINJA (sadly):	SMOKE BOMB.
	(SOUNDFX: sad Charlie Brown music)
	(NINJA walks off to Charlie Brown sad music Arrested Developmentstyle.)



NARRATOR: Team ISIS. 
EVERYONE: Is Is! SISI MEAT! Undefeated in taunts and games. Last year’s WKL champions. Until last week. Apocalips WOW, a team of gangly theatre nerds, bests Team ISIS both theatrically and, to everyone’s surprise, also athletically. How will they react to their newfound kickball dominance?
COLLEEN: Alright, alright people. We’re up against Bad Guys today, so let’s get this taunt planned. Cris: sew us some new costumes; I want us to look like a strungout, cutrate burlesque show. Bill: I need like a dozen solid dick jokes from you, understand? Jon: get me some impossibly obscure film references. The more pretentious the better! Let’s do what we do best people, come on! (claps hands, everyone scurries around)
NICOLE: No. No you guys. We just beat the best team in the WKL. By the transitive property, this makes us the best team in the league. It’s algebra.
JON: (using calculator) She’s right, you know.
NICOLE: And we’re playing the Bad Guys, who are really good at kickball. So here you guys, put these on—
(throws logo tshirts at everyone)
we’re not a fun team anymore. Repeat after me: we’re not a fun team!
EVERYONE: We’re not a fun team!
NICOLE: So you better look the part. I’m going to whip you into shape!
(Eye of the Tiger plays and we have a series of choreographed sight gags. Two sets of three people do the exercise, NICOLE and COLLEEN alternate coaching, screwing it up)

NICOLE: Alright kick some balls. Alright, yeah! (Team kicks balls and does shots WHEN NICOLE TURNS AWAY)

COLLEEN: Alright work those abs! Okay! (Team does situps and then does shots WHEN COLLEEN TURNS AWAY)

NICOLE: Alright team work those biceps! Pump that iron! (Team lifts weights and then sings into the weights WHEN NICOLE TURNS AWAY)
TEAM: Rising up! Back on the street!

COLLEEN: Keep those hands up! Fuck that bag up! Alright! (Team punches bag and then breaks it and drinks it WHEN COLLEEN TURNS AWAY)

NICOLE: Pushups! Keep your head up, come on! (Team does pushups and snorts coke WHEN NICOLE TURNS AWAY)

COLLEEN: Work those lats! Yeah! (Team uses exercise bands, then shoots heroin WHEN COLLEEN TURNS AWAY)

NICOLE: Alright stretch it out you guys, keep it loose! (Team stretches and fucks)

COLLEEN: Come on you junkies, get up those stairs go go go and now Jazz Hands! (Team does Jazz Hands)

 (everyone collapses from exhaustion)
NARRATOR: After ten minutes of physical exertion, Apocalips WOW realizes: their lungs hurt. Their livers hurt. They’re feeling excruciating pain in organs they didn’t even know they had.
EVERYONE: THE HORROR. THE HORROR.
NARRATOR: But goddammit, they look good.
NICOLE: Wait a minute, no they don’t! Look at these fuckwads! They spent the whole practice smoking, drinking, and doing needle drugs!
COLLEEN: Yeah, come on, how bad are the bad guys really?
NICOLE: They’re really good at kickball!
COLLEN: We’ve only won one game.
NICOLE: They have stable lives, 2.3 kids and mortgages!
COLLEEN: What’s a mortgage? What’s a kid?
NICOLE: I never see them drinking shots at the bar!
COLLEEN: Holy fuck, I forgot to pay my bar tab!
NICOLE: Oh my god, Colleen…
COLLEEN: …we’re the real bad guys.
EVERYONE: Apocalips! OW! My liver!


Shifty as hell man
He studies the floor
Vinyl and nitrate
The scent we ignore
Flying past Ballard
I step to the door
Cylinder spinning
In the old fortyfour

Study your fingernails
Here comes the chime
Plus minus five minutes
Given the time
Over your shoulder
Stinking of lime
Take out your bike lock
The thing is I’m

Going home (4X)

The obituary said
He kept his hands in the car
Sometimes had cigarettes
Couldn’t stand cigars
And he couldn’t write a song
But he could play guitar

ZACH: I say Emory, philanthropy is its own reward.
EMORY: I know! I feel such a sense of overwhelming selfsatisfaction that we’re going to 9 Million In Unmarked Bills to donate money to victims of the Estate Tax increase.
ZACH: Personally, I prefer my money in billions. But you know, some people have to get by on mere hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
EVERYONE: The horror! The horror!
ZACH: Why do we both talk like David Attenborough with a stroke?
EMORY: I don’t know, Zach!
ZACH: Say, this doesn’t look like the 9 Mil. Let’s get the lay of the land!
(they get out of the limo)
HOMELESS#1: Real change? Real change?
EMORY: Oh I say! They’re feral! Zach, do something!
ZACH: Pull harder on your bootstraps, you welfare queen!
(pepper sprays HOMELESS 1)
HOMELESS#1: Augh!
EMORY: How terrible!
ZACH: Oh dear, Emory, I think it’s the moment we’ve all feared. People shambling about, poorly dressed, reeking of garbage. It’s the zombie apocalypse!
HOMELESS#2: (coming out of the portapotty) Hand sanitizer? Hand sanitizer?
EMORY: Oh god, they’re attacking! Here have some money! Meh! (throws money)
HOMELESS#2: Hey thanks, I—
ZACH: Zombies don’t want money Emory, kill him!
(kills HOMELESS 2)
HOMELESS: (cooking on a camp stove)
Hey guys, you want a hot dog?
ZACH: Oh my god they’re eating dogs!
EMORY: Only in Obama’s America! We’re outnumbered, Zach!
ZACH: Oh dear? What would Mitt Romney do?
EMORY: MRomney? He’d flip flop!
EVERYONE: We built tent city!
EMORY: Zach, don’t you see? We have to change sides!
EVERYONE: We built tent city On kicking balls
EMORY: Wait, where are we anyway? We never found the 9 Mil!
(reveal: sheet drops and there is a giant microscope pointing at Kevin’s balls)
SONG (choreographed)
We built taint city
On Kevin’s balls

KEVIN: 
Yeah doc, it's like my balls are taunting me.

LYDIA: 
Yes, well this is obviously an advanced stage of WKLV which includes parasitic testicular infestation and visual hallucinations of taunt excellence.
As you know, any advice I give you is voluntary yet highly recommended. First, no more getting naked in public. This is for your safety and for gods sake no one wants to see your Peanuts Gang, I mean Penis... Gangi... and second just rub a few benjamins on it and that will give you the stimulus your package needs.

EVERYONE: Apocalypse DOW!

Scene opens with a funeral march. Procession is playing “When the Saints go marching in.” Pallbearers are carrying two caskets. Stop in front of a podium.

PREACHER: We are gathered here today to mourn the passing of our dear friends Forrest, Bubba, and LIEUTENANTDAN. But we are not here merely to witness their passing but also to celebrate the richness of their lives.

Flashback (sign?). Everyone but Beatrice and Geraline lies down. Mothers get up on rocking chairs.

BEATRICE: Now Geraline, I don’t mean to talk outside my place, but your son Rob—and I don’t know why he insists on being called Bubba

GERALINE: And your son, (NAME), calling himself Forrest, as he does—

(NICOLE NEED HELP HERE)

BEATRICE: Well he’s got (personal problems, possibly stupid).

GERALINE: Your son’s no better, he’s (likewise).

BEATRICE: They’re turning into a couple of Bourbon Street Bawlers (rubs eyes in crying motion). By which I mean: they crybabies.

GERALINE: Good thing we sent them both to Vietnam.

Cut to Vietnam. Knock rocking chairs over lay down. Explosions, kickballs are flying everywhere.

FORREST: (carrying LIEUTENANTDAN) BUBBA! I’m going back for Bubba!

LIEUTENANTDAN: Soldier! You keep your ass at second base! You had better tag up, you stupid motherfucker!

FORREST: NO! I gotta get Bubba!

FORREST runs to third base, dodging kickballs. Picks up Bubba at third base and starts carrying him to home base.

LIEUTENANTDAN: SOLDIER WHAT ARE YOU DOING! THIS DOESN’T MAKE ANY SENSE IN THE CONTEXT OF A KICKBALL GAME! YOU CAN’T CARRY A MAN TO HOME PLATE!

FORREST: BUBBA!

BUBBA: FORREST!

FORREST: We got shrimp nuggets, we got shrimp titties, we got—AUGGHH!

FORREST gets pegged in the ass with a kickball and goes down. They crawl to home.

BUBBA: (sensual caressing) You saved my life, Forrest.

FORREST: We got shrimp booties…

BUBBA: Forrest! Come on now, forget the shrimp for a minute, I love you like a brother, Forrest.

FORREST: We got shrimp anus, we got shrimp…

BUBBA: But not like a cousin, because then I’d have to penetrate you.

Narration. Everyone drops to the ground. MOTHERS get up into rocking chairs.

GERALINE: Vietnam done changed those boys. 

BEATRICE: But not for the better! 

GERALINE: All that carousing with foreign hookers!

BEATRICE: And tertiary syphilis! 

GERALINE: It went straight to their brains!

BEATRICE: Who knew they’d be catering kickball parties?

MOTHERS drop to the ground. LIEUTENANTDAN rolls up in a wheelchair, sans legs. FORREST is running laps, and LIEUTENANTDAN is chasing him as fast as he can in his wheelchair.

LIEUTENANTDAN: Forrest. Bubba. I’m throwing the sluttiest Mardi Gras party the Bayou has ever seen. I need you boys to cater it.

Enter LEISURE SUIT LARRY.

LSL: Sluttiest Mardi Gras party the Bayou has ever seen? Tell you what, I’ll give you 13 and a quarter shrimp tits for handful of each of your pubes.

LIEUTENANTDAN: Make it 12 and three quarters and you’ve got yourself a deal!

LIEUTENANTDAN, FORREST, and BUBBA cut off their pubes and hand them to LSL. LSL runs off, cackling. Everyone falls down but LSL. 1UP YOURS stands up.

SOMEONE: (stirring pot) Have you completed your task, Leisure Suit Larry? 

LSL: (crouched over) LOVE IT!

SOMEONE: Excellent. Let’s Katrina those publicsector pirate hoboes once and for all.

Hands off doll and hair to KEN

KEN: (holding doll in air) Run Forrest, Run!

1UPYOURS: (Maniacal laughter)

Forrest starts running around the bases.

FORREST: Bubba! Take care of the shrimp business! I’m just runnin’! I can’t stop runnin’!

DUCK HUNT holds BUBBA doll aloft.

DUCK HUNT: Pull! (DUCK HUNT throws BUBBA doll, someone else shoots it)

BUBBA collapses on the field, dead. FORREST is running around the field. The party coalesces around him including several girls with shrimp pasties and LIEUTENANTDAN. Trance music. Drag?

LIEUTENANTDAN: BUBBA! Come here ladies. Bubba would have wanted it this way. (Starts eating shrimp off of the pasties. Begins choking.)

FORREST collapses from running too much and dies.

OLD LADY EPILOGUE.

END.



FREEMAN: Hello, I’m Morgan Freeman. 
CHIEF: Freeman! I’d like you to investigate an adorable anomaly!
FREEMAN: But I’ve gotta go get donuts and—
CHIEF:  You can narrate nature films later, Freeman. Your job is to investigate the cutest damn crime scenes I’ve ever seen, so don’t give me any grief. Now you and your partner
PITT:  Hi, I’m Brad Pitt. You might remember me from such films as
CHIEF:  Shut up, Pitt! We’ve got a real freak show today starring a dead kickball player, and I want you to figure it out before it leads to the apocalypse.
(Siren noises, Pitt pulls a sheet/body bag off of dead Justin)
PITT: Have you ever seen anything like this?
FREEMAN: Looks like Justin ate Cupcake Royale until he could barely walk.
PITT: I don’t quite get how this is cute, Morgan.
FREEMAN: Shut up, Pitt! Look, a trail of pink socks. Let’s follow it.
PITT: Pink socks?! MY FAVORITE! (Puts on the socks)
(Dead Justin discreetly leaves. Pitt and Freeman walk in place while a sign saying ‘Generic Seattle Biotech Company’ drifts by)
FREEMAN: Look over here. It’s like someone drowned in a Hot Topic warehouse.
PITT: My god. Some poor soul hoarded expensive gothic lolita dresses until she suffocated under a mountain of anime corsets and lollipops.
FREEMAN: And over here: more pink socks.
PITT: MORE pink socks?! My favorite!
(Enter Sloth from Goonies fucking a sloth with a Baby Ruth and the threetoed sloth is dead)
EVERYONE: Hey you guys!
SLOTH: Baby Ruth! Aaaaggghhh!
PITT: I don’t get it! What’s the crime? I just see two consenting adults!
FREEMAN: You don’t understand: there is a sin called sloth, there is also a guy called sloth, and there is a dead monkey that doesn’t really look like a sloth, but I assure you is in fact a sloth, and is getting buggered by a candy bar. 
PITT:  Wait, I get it! There are 7 deadly sins like in that movie we were in, and if this darkly delectable plot reaches fruition, it will lead to a singularity of cuteness, and the resulting cutepocalypse will destroy the WKL.
FREEMAN: Shut up, Pitt! Why don’t you stick a sock in it! It’s a goddamned sloth!
	PITT: (puts sock in mouth) Who could be committing these apocalyptic crimes?
FREEMAN: Look at the pattern: Justin covered in cupcakes. Gothic Lolita dresses. Someone in a cute animal costume. Bestiality. Only one kickball team is capable of plotting such endearing crimes: those sexy singers, Apocalypse Wow!
EVERYONE: The horror, the horror.
(Sign goes across saying ‘Somewhere in South Seattle’. Enter SHARRI, sitting holding a lion doll. PITT follows a trail of socks towards her.)
PITT: Look, more pink socks! You gotta get in on this Morg.
FREEMAN: Dammit, Pitt, you know I’m a birkenstocks guy.
(Sharri stands, holds up lion doll. SOUNDFX: intro to Circle of Life)
  SHARRI: We all love cute, but cute and cute? And then cute, and cute, and another cute? That’s so much cute, my ears are bleeding from all the squealing people were doing during taunt planning. How can you handle this week after week? Have you no pride? (emphasis on pride)
PITT: But Sharri
EVERYONE: Shut up, Pitt!
(music switches to something moral and grandmotherly like this is 2 scenes occurring at once, SHARRI narrating and PITT whining. SHARRI is on one side, CHRISTINE, the box, and PITT on the other. I think FREEMAN just walks off disgusted at the confusion, or sits down.)
SHARRI: You can’t have beginning without end…
CHRISTINE: Special delivery for Brad Pitt.
PITT:  What’s in the Box?
SHARRI: You can’t have creation without apocalypse. 
PITT:  (louder/more aggressive) What’s in the box? Come on. What’s in the box?!
SHARRI:  And we all know apocalypse knocks the socks off of cute.
PITT: (as an aside, opening the box, still whiny)
I really hope people are getting the box reference from the movie here.
SHARRI: (ideally replace ‘goddamned’ with a reference from their taunt)
And that apocalyptic pumpkin dog is cuter than any goddamned thing 
you have going. Squeeeeal.
EVERYONE:  Apocalypse BOW WOW?


Fin.


(NICOLE and JEFF are sitting on a love seat in their living room with Jasper in front of a TV. The TV is a modified picnic tent.)
NICOLE: Well Jeff, we’ve got an hour before we have to take the field for our final taunt… nobody’s home… are you thinking what I’m thinking?
JEFF: Yeah honey, let’s watch some TV!.
(SOUNDFX: “Bad Boys”)
(Turns on TV: Fox. Bad Boys theme song starts up and there’s a cage with the mannequin with a strapon in it and HIRAM torturing it. COP enters.)
COP: WKLPD. Hiram Hye Brown, you’re under arrest.
HIRAM: Officer, we didn’t kidnap him, we have a deal!
COP: Shut up, you horrible pervert. You’ve been reported for breach of contract. You promised that gimp a blowjob. And you’d best keep that promise if you want to stay out of prison.
(Dueling banjos starts. HIRAM starts blowing the mannequin.)
NICOLE: Oh god, change the channel! Anything! Now! Now!
(Channel change: Bloomberg News)
FINANCIALCOMMENTATOR#1: So the end of the WKL season is upon us, and the NADSAQ is tumbling. PBR shares are down one thousand percent since the market opened this morning, and the orgy index has collapsed. Investors on Ball Street are panicking after losing 62.5% of their taunts due to the general unpleasantness of rich people. They’ve been seen harassing the referees, claiming they’re, quote: “Too big to fail and yes I’m talking about my penis,” endquote. We go live to the scene now, Chris what’s happening over there?
FINANCIALCOMMENTATOR#2: It’s absolute chaos, Jon. I see a Ball Street investor out on a window ledge. Hang on, he’s saying something to the crowd.
KEVIN: 3 and 5 in taunts—I can’t take it!
EVERYONE: Jump! Jump!
(KEVIN jumps)
NICOLE: Best stock report ever! Love it or hate it?
JEFF: Love it! 
NICOLE: Hey, speaking of terrible team ideas, isn’t Caddyshack on?
(Channel change: TNT)
BILL MURRAY as CARL SPACKLER: (mumbling, holding mannequin under arms so it’s facing the audience)
So I jump ship in Hong Kong and make my way over to Tibet, and I get on as a looper at a course over in the Himalayas. A looper, you know, a caddy, a looper, a jock. So, I tell them I'm a pro jock, and who do you think they give me? The Dalai Lama, himself. Twelfth son of the Lama.

JEFF: (interrupting whenever he wants)
That guy is more incoherent than Barry. I’m hungry, let’s check out the Food Network.
(Channel change: Food Network)
QUESTION: We don’t have the Dcup cakes/tittycakes joke written in. Do we want to add it at the end?
CYRIL: Welcome to the French Chef, I’m Julia Child! With me this week is my guest, Chef Louisette, who is a Real French Chef!
JULIA: Bonjour, Julia!
CYRIL: So later this episode we’ll show you how to prepare tittycakes and Cute Cute Cute JellO shots, but first we’ll be making Is Is Meat—
JULIA: Non, Sisi Meat! Sisi!
CYRIL: Oui oui, Sisi Meat! So to make this delicious treat, you take an ordinary sausage. (Pulls out huge sausage) First you have to slightly warm the sausage like so (starts masturbating the sausage)
JULIA: Non non, la saussice est beaucoup trops grande!
CYRIL: Oh, too large? (pulls out cleaver, chops it in half, throws one half into the audience and holds up the other one)
JULIA: (gaping in horror) Alternately: Quelle horreur! Quelle horreur!
CYRIL: (pulls out hot dog) How about this one?
JULIA: Elle doit etre vraiment riquiqui.
CYRIL: Oh, still too large? How’s this? (pulls out cocktail sausage)
JULIA: Oui oui! Voila du Sisi meat!
CYRIL: So I prepared a sample of this delight earlier today, and here it is! (pulls out TEAM ISIS TROPHY?!? Or mannequin on cookie sheet) Oh, how did this get in here? Let’s just throw that in the trash. (Delicately places it in trash can with Julia’s assistance)
NICOLE: Is that what I think it is?
JEFF: Let’s just say this is the closest we’ll ever get to that particular trophy.
(IGGY and JASPER are chained to the ground in the center of the screen. SOUNDFX:  JAWS theme as AGATA, wearing a bear suit and pink socks walks towards them carrying a sledgehammer.)
NICOLE: Oh god. Oh god. Get rid of that Now Now Now!
JEFF: Okay, I’m sick of TV. Let’s Play Doctor Mario!
(Plays Doctor Mario. JEFF and NICOLE should ad lib or write some dialogue)
NICOLE: Oh my God, Jeff, I’m sick of watching you play video games. What’s on Nickelodeon?
(Channel change: COLLEEN or AGATA calling back to Kickelodeon taunt, covered in blood wearing a Mayan headdress, holds a heart up in the air. The mannequin gets showered in blood)
NICOLE: What the fuck is that? This is for kids? Where the fuck is Spongebob?
JEFF: (gets up and bangs on TV) This can’t be Nickelodeon! This can’t be Nickelodeon!
(Channel change: Nick at Night)
(NOTE: THIS NEEDS WORK, ADD MORE?)
SONG: 
A horse is a horse, of course, of course
And horses love intercourse, of course
But then the horse
With the most force
Is the famous Fister Ed!

A horse is a horse, of course, of course
And every horse fucks with his dick, of course
That is, of course,
Unless that horse,
Is the famous Fister Ed!
(Action throughout: someone wearing a horse masks slowly puts on a rubber glove, then maybe chases around someone dressed like HARRY POTTER?!?. Then the horse gets lassoed by BILL. Stab eyes out somehow? ANDY and JONATHAN run on stage and highfive in the center)
ANDY and JONATHAN: Equus reference! Boom!
JEFF: You know, I loved that show when I was a kid.
NICOLE: What?!?
JEFF: Uh… what’s on AMC?
(Channel change: AMC)
(COLLEEN is sitting on a piano, maybe MANNEQUIN is set up on at a bench playing the piano?)
COLLEEN: (singing to All That Jazz)
Team Capowned
Why don’t we play kick ball
And all that jazz
(HERE WE SET UP THE NEXT SET)
I’m gonna have some drinks
Put on a leotard
And all that jazz
JEFF: (AT END OF FIRST VERSE)
No, no, cut it, cut it. Stop the track. Capowned isn’t worth it.
NICOLE: Oh hey, I think Mythbusters is on Discovery right now.
(Channel change: Discovery)
(Hot Tub is set up in stage. TINA and DANNY are hiding inside hot tub. BUSTER (aka mannequin) is propped up, visible inside the hot tub).
ADAM: Welcome to Mythbusters; today we’ll be investigating the urban legend of whether or not you can actually travel in time in a hot tub!
JAMIE: Well Adam, the answer is hell no.
ADAM: You’re right Jamie, time travel is basically impossible under the Standard Model. But, since we have an hour of television to kill, let’s blow up this hot tub in slow motion!
(TINA and DANNY rise up from hiding in the hot tub)
TINA: Danny, where are we?
DANNY: Don’t you mean, when are we, Tina?
TINA: Haha! That is so right! I mean, when are we, Danny?
ADAM: All right, explosion in T10 seconds.
DANNY: Tina, have I ever told you that you are just so damned cute?
TINA: (Giggles)
JAMIE: We’ve got fifty pounds of TNT in this thing. The force could be great enough to send pieces of this thing into orbit. Eye protection, everyone!
(JAMIE and ADAM put on eye protection)
TINA: Hey, shouldn’t we be saying something just unbearably adorable right
(Explosion. Hot Tub gets ripped to shreds, TINA and DANNY are lying on the ground. AGATA drives her tank over them, firing the confetti cannon. Static curtain goes up and stays up.)
JEFF: Let’s turn this off, we’ve got to get going.
(Black screen replaces static sheet. JEFF and NICOLE get up and go out the door. Whole tent picks up and turns 180 degrees to reveal a beach scene on the back)
COLLEEN: Hey guys, glad you made it. You ready?
NICOLE: Let’s do this. Everyone, places? Play us out!

Surfin’ Vietnam
Well it’s the end of the season
It’s time to say so long
The apocalypse is coming
At the end of the song
It’s going to be alright though
We should all keep calm
Everybody go surfing
Surfing Vietnam

We’ve got you all figured out now (Inside, outside, Vietnam)
Here’s how you win a taunt
Give the audience free drinks
It’s alcohol they want
Show everybody your tits too
Our tits are pretty bomb
That was for Kickelodeon
Surfing Vietnam

When we know who’s in third place
I guess we’ll write this verse
ISIS, Hot tub, or Doctors
Which of you is least worst
Then again does it matter?
I guess we don’t give a damn
There’s no time to rewrite this
Surfing Vietnam

You know we’re into high concept (Inside, outside, Vietnam)
That’s what theatre’s for
We’re gonna kill Martin Brando
But he’s a metaphor
Did you read Heart of Darkness?
He’s Imperialisam
Vote Ron Paul in November
(Hold up sign: This is a joke, please do not vote for Ron Paul in November)
Surfing Vietnam

EVERYONE: CHARLIE! DON’T SURF!


Good evening everybody, and welcome to the show
We’re gonna get this started, says the plumber: (Bill pops out of pipe) (Letsa go!)

Here’s a little story ‘bout a Princess we call Peach
Was hanging with the plumber; Bowser took her out of reach (Bowser picks up Peach and runs off)

Now Peach is up for grabs so kickballers gotta front
Step up and win these games and you might just see her cunt

I’d like to see some drinking, how about you?
Gonna beat some teams up here, the only question’s who

Cut the CRAAP motherfuckers, ‘cause This Is Kickball (Hold up signs?)
Bourbon Street Ballers we’re gonna take you all

Now you’re in the desert, it’s full of fucking sand (Throw sand at captains?)
Be good and drink your vodka, just please don’t use your hands

The game is called Oasis, it’s better than the band
Put your face into this bucket, drink that shit until you’re slammed

We win Oasis, possibly by making their Jello shots taste unbearably disgusting? Or by freezing them or something. Jello shots have hot sauce in them? Or by wearing goggles. “Wonderwall” is playing.

Water music plays. Team is waltzing.

COLLEEN:

1Up wins
That’s how it works
Who’s surprised?
It’s rigged; ‘cause we’re jerks

In this match
You can still win that snatch
Who’s got
The best tits in the WKL?

Promoterboat
And Team Zissou
Jingle Juggs, we’re gonna
hand your ass to you

We’re the same
Because we lose most games
But still
I think we are the hottest team up here.

 “Under the Sea” plays. Not sure how we cheat on this one, or even if we need to. Propose boat race of followed by surprise wet tshirt contest. Our team is wearing white tshirts.

Castle music plays


Oh no! (That’s right!) It’s him! (It’s me!)
It’s Bowser you see!
JEFF:

You kickball hipsters
You’ve come quite far but
You thought you’d save her
Still she’ll be my slut
MARIO:

No Bowser, fuck you
We want her sweet tits
We challenge you to
A battle of our wits


Our contestant is visibly drunk and vomits after several terrible answers.
RAY:

Raise your hand if you’ve been fisted this season. We just wanted to know.
Which member of WKL left their virginity at BF Day? (Nobody here is a virgin)
Who has generated the most spam via Facebook messages? (JoAnna/Luke)
Name one team with extant restraining orders (Jingle Juggs)
Name one team that has a DUI. (Bourbon St. Ballers)
How many penises (not including Kevin’s) have you seen in taunts this season? (1)
Who needs to shut the fuck up about the goddamned rope swing? (Sean McBride)

FINAL JEOPARDY

Name all the items that have been left at BF Day? (Scorpion costume, Colleen’s shoes… Bring out child.)

(Bowser gasps and the battle of wits begins. We lose to someone from the audience.)

CHUN LI: Oh no! We’ve lost Agata to the WKL! She’ll be gangbanged mercilessly!

WALUIGI: Don’t worry! The joke’s on them—Princess Agata has vagina dentata! 

(Reveal Chomp underwear)

Hakuna Matata plays.

NICOLE:
Vagina Dentata
What an awful malaise!
AGATA:
Vagina Dentata
Let’s have some cock fillets!

It means no penis!
For the rest of your days!
It’s our pleasurefree…
Calamity…

Vagina Dentata
Vagina Dentata
Vagina Dentata
Vagina Dentata
Vagina Dentata
Vagina Dentata
Vagina Dentata
Vagina Dentata

Take Agata here—
Why, when she was a young princess

When I was a young princess!

Very nice.

Thank you.

She found her vagina had a couple of teeth
She could chew up a zucchini with the mouth down beneath

I’ve a desperate hole! Though I’ve not yet sinned.
And it hurt! When my lovers would stick it in!
And oh the blood! (There was so much blood!)
It poured out like a flood! (Oh god what a flood!)
And it totally sucked (My god how it sucked!)
Every time I got fu—

Agata!

Yes?

The word you’re looking for is “fucked,” I don’t know why I interrupted you.

Vagina Dentata
What an awful malaise!
Vagina Dentata
Let’s have some cock fillets!

It means no penis!
For the rest of your days!
It’s our pleasurefree…
Calamity…

Vagina Dentata!

(Vagina! Dentata!)
(Vagina! Dentata!)


BILL:  Taunt Machine? More like Taunt Latrine, am I right?
REFEREE:  (BLOWS WHISTLE) He’s right, you know. After an embarrassingly small amount of deliberation, we conclude that Apocalips WOW wins the taunt!
NICOLE: Obviously there will be no bunting. (To AUDIENCE) I’m calling it now.
TINA#1: Fuck! Wait, I can fix this! I’ll use the Hot Tub Taunt Machine to go back in time, steal the Apocalips WOW taunt and give it to my past self in an unprecedented act of taunt espionage! Not like THAT’s ever been done before. (Huey Lewis and the News, Gonna Go Back In Time)
TINA#2: (Grading papers) A... A... A... I looove second graders! Their writing reminds me of our taunts! Done in Crayon!
TINA#1: Psst. Tina from two days ago! Here’s the Apocalips WOW taunt! (Whispers in TINA 2’s ear)
TINA#2: Gasp! I’ll improve our taunt posthaste!
(Sign reads: June 6, 2012)
NICOLE: Now it calling I’m bunting. No be will there Obviously.
REFEREE: Taunt! The wins WOW Apocalips that conclude we deliberation, of amount small embarrassingly an After know. You right, He’s (BLOWS WHISTLE)
BILL: Right? I am Latrine, Taunt like More Machine Taunt

BILL: In taunting you so ineffectively, we have shamed ourselves and our families. Tonight, we drink only our tears.
REFEREE: (BLOWS WHISTLE) He’s right you know. After an embarrassingly small amount of deliberation, we conclude that Hot Tub Taunt Machine wins the taunt!
NICOLE: OH GOD THE INCESSANT BUNTING!
TINA#2: Hey guys! Let’s celebrate our glorious win with an epic rager in the Hot Tub! You guys get in; I’ll serenade you with Karaoke!
EVERYONE: Hooray, kind of!
TINA#2: (Singing) IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME (accidentally knocks the block rocker into hot tub, electrocuting everyone).
TINA#2: Oh god. Oh god. I killed half the WKL and my future self! This is the kickball apocalypse! The horror! The horror! I’ll have to go back in time and set things right! (pushes all the corpses out of the hot tub, Huey Lewis and the News, Gonna Go Back In Time)
BILL: Right? I am Latrine, Taunt like More Machine Taunt
(Sign reads: June 6, 2012)
REFEREE: (BLOWS WHISTLE) After an embarrassingly small amount of deliberation, we conclude that Hot Tub Taunt Machine wins the taunt!
TINA#2: TINA, I HAVE TO STOP YOU FROM DOING KARAOKE!
TINA#3: (Huey Lewis and the News, Gonna Go Back In Time) TINA, YOU MUSTN’T STOP TINA FROM DOING KARAOKE!
TINA#4: (Huey Lewis and the News, Gonna Go Back In Time) TINA! Don’t bleach your hair and get that short haircut! You look like a boy!
TINA#5: (Huey Lewis and the News, Gonna Go Back In Time) Oh my god I have to stop myself from dating Luke!
TINA#6: (Huey Lewis and the News, Gonna Go Back In Time) Tina. I’ve always wanted to do this. (Make out. Time after time)
TINA#7: (Huey Lewis and the News, Gonna Go Back In Time. Terminator music. Sarah Conner enters) (Grabs realworld Tina from audience, says emphatically) Tina. Never use the taunt machine again. If you use time travel to cheat the WKL, it will be destroyed. And you’ll give yourself future genital HTTM.
BILL: (Huey Lewis and the News, Gonna Go Back In Time) Taunt Machine? More like Taunt Latrine, am I right?
Everyone runs around to crazy music and then pees in the hottub, surrounding Ferguson. We turn around and say Apocapiss Wow!
NICOLE: “What are you doing Ferguson?”
FERGUSON: “They said not to pee in the hot tub.”
Dun dun dun dun dun dun, poo.
Everyone: “Apocalips Poo!”



JAMES LIPTON: Good evening, and welcome to another episode of Inside the Taunt Studio. I’m James Lipton. Tonight, we look back on the unparalleled taunt dominance of the undefeated Apocalips WOW, formerly 1 UP Yours, formerly Mission Implausible. I’m here with Nicole Greer, captain of the aforementioned team. Nicole. How did you develop your team concept?
NICOLE: Alcohol. Next question.
JAMES LIPTON: You were a member of Mission Implausible in 2010, a team that lost a couple taunts over the course of the season. Can you elaborate on how adjusting your roster improved your team dynamics? 
NICOLE: Well, so first we had to cut a guy after we realized he couldn’t come to team meetings because of all the restraining orders. But that’s another story. As for the rest of them? Let me put it this way. Some people join kickball because they think it’s a child’s game. And some people join kickball because they want to get laid. And some people think they can combine the two.
(flashback)
LANCE: Alright Mission Implausible, it’s that time of year again. We’ve got our team names down to: 1UP Yours, Apocalips WOW, and Sparkle Porn Power. 
(enter van)
CHILD: (running out of the back of the van)
Mommy! Mommy!
LUKE and PEE WEE: (They walk out of the back of the van, look down, and close their zippers in unison. PEE WEE is carrying an opaque bag.)
AWOW#1: Oh hey Luke, we were just talking about team name ideas.
LUKE: Oh right. I’ve got a great idea for a team: Kickelodeon.
LANCE: What? Why?
PEE WEE: Well think about it, we could combine the television that those li’l Rugrats enjoy with drinking, shitting our pants, and masturbation! What’s that show where kids are penalized for being wrong by being covered in a viscous goo? Isn’t that a great idea?
AWOW#2: PEE WEE, that’s a terrible idea, because I’m of legal drinking age.
LUKE: No wait, hear me out, a lot of people in the league have kids nowadays, and the kids will really appreciate that. They need something to…
PEE WEE: (at same time as KICKELODEON 1 is talking, spills drink)
Fuck!
LUKE: …they need something to do. I think they’d all really like to “Salute my Shorts” if you know what I mean.
AWOW#1: I’m hoping I don’t know what you mean.
(Only include this joke if we can mock up a tshirt)
LUKE: (pulls out a tshirt with the KICKELODEON logo, except the text is dark and the logo looks like a white semen stain)
LUKE: Come on guys, I think this is a really solid team idea. We can all wear these tshirts!
AWOW#2: What is that, dude? Your cumrag?
PEEWEE: I feel like I’m not explaining myself well. What I want to do is take the kids of the WKL…
AWOW#1: Okay…
PEEWEE: And bring them in my rape van for deep deep
LUKE: Waitwaitwait! You know, I actually liked that Sparkle Porn Power idea, except can we involve children or preteens in some way?
AWOW#2: Dude! What the hell?
(Smacks PEEWEE on the arm, bag of dildos with smiley faces falls out. Awkward pause.)
TEAMAWOW: (slowly, with feeling)
The Horror, The Horror!
AWOW#1: I was a kid once!
SHARRI: That was you guys?! You sick sons of bitches!
VIOLENCE ENSUES, VAN IS DESTROYED.



BILLMURRAY: (Wakes up to I’ve Got You Babe playing on alarm clock. Splashes water/beer on his face. Looks outside. Title card reads: Groundhog day)
Every day I wake up and I’m still Bill Murray. It’s awesome. 
EVERYONE: The horror! The horror!
BILLMURRAY: (Picks up phone) Get me Wes Anderson. I’ve got an audition to rock.
(Slow walks to the Kill Bill music. Uncomfortably long.)
UMATHURMAN: FIVE FINGER PALM OF DEATH!
BILL MURRAY: Do you know who I am? I’m Bill fucking Murray.
UMATHURMAN: (The previous title card is cut through with the sword to reveal: KILL BILL MURRAY)
Kill Bill Murray!
STEVEZISSOU(THE LIFE AQUATIC): Is it you or does it smell like rotten fish in here?
(Is beaten to death with some aquatic animals)
HUNTERSTHOMPSON(FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS):
We can’t stop here! This is bat country!
UMA THURMAN: Hey Hunter, I’ve got a pie of cocaine.
(Offer a little cocaine, then pie him in the face with the rest)
CARLSPACKLER(CADDYSHACK): In the immortal words of Jean Paul Sartre: Au revoir gopher!
(Fences with Uma wielding a golf club, is cut down)
ERNIEMCKRACKEN(KINGPIN): (Carrying bowling ball)
I’m so secure in my stardom I can make a bowling movie.
UMA THURMAN: Hey, remember when we made you guys eat balls?
(Beats him to death with a bowling pin)
ANYONE: Coke pie! Coke pie!
DR.VINKMAN(GHOSTBUSTERS): Oh no a ghost!
GHOST: I am the ghost of the Nuge! This man has no dick!
DR.VINKMAN: Remember when we ate balls together?
GHOST: (Slimes him using plastic bag full of whipped cream dyed with green dye)
ANYONE: Coke pie! Coke pie!
GARFIELD: I hate Mondays. And now, Wednesdays.
UMATHURMAN: (Runs him over with a lawnmower)
EVERYONE: Apocalips COKE PIE!
(Flour on everyone in crowd esp. The Murrays)


Open on three nerds (taped glasses, pocket protectors if we can get ‘em). One of these is KEVIN. All characters drink Mountain Dew throughout.

ZACH: Hey Kevin, Emory, check out this flier I found! Dungeon party! I bet we can play D&D all night!

EMORY: Guys, this starts in 2 hours, let’s get over there!

2 hours later sign. Scene transitions to banging club music. Outside, there is a NAUGHTY NURSE. NERDS are dressed in medieval garb.

NURSE: Hello boys. Mmm, that’s a big… sword you have there. You’ll be just right, join our dungeon party.

ZACH: By Gandalf’s grey merkin! We’re playing D&D with girls!

EMORY: I haven’t been this excited since that plane full of inflatable sex dolls crashed into my house!

KEVIN: Why do these things happen only to you?

ZACH: Kevin, don’t ask questions, just go inside.

NURSE: Yeah, come inside boys!

NERDS stair walk, row, and take the elevator behind the table.

KEVIN: I guess I’ll take the stairs.

ZACH: I’m getting in the boat.

EMORY: You guys are idiots, I’m taking the elevator.

Props appear to indicate that we are now inside the club. Torches, hanging BDSM things. Painted sheet to look like cobblestone background. Music is louder now. Nerds are approached by the DUNGEON MASTER who is wearing as much BDSM garb as we can find. He is in the middle of some kinky act, which he ceases to address the NERDS.

MASTER: HALT, WORMS! WHO DARES ENTER MY SEPULCHRE OF PHALLIC HORRORS!

ZACH: Holy shit, they’re really into this.

EMORY: Uh, it is I! Mongolian Beef, level 5 Wizard! And I cast MAGIC MISSILES.

EMORY waves his arms.

KEVIN: And you take 1d4+1 force damage, so…

MASTER: NO! YOU TAKE THIS FLOGGING, BITCH!

NURSES begin whipping all the NERDS.

ZACH: Ow! This isn’t LARP! I can’t LARP!

EMORY: Why? You’re clerics, you’re supposed to heal us! Why?

KEVIN: Oh God, here, take my lunch money, I’ll eat grass again, just let me be!

MASTER: (to the audience) SOMEHOW I FEEL AS THOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN MISLED INTO THIS REALM OF SUFFERING. (to the NERDS) RISE, AND OBEY MY NEW DIRECTIVE. YOU WILL NOW BATTLE ADVERSARIES SO BEAUTIFUL AND TERRIBLE THAT YOU WILL SURELY FAIL. AND WHEN YOU DO, YOU WILL REMOVE YOUR GARMENTS.

KEVIN: Wait, wait are we getting naked? Please tell me we’re getting naked.

MASTER: YOU WILL NOT REVEAL YOURSELF UNTIL INSTRUCTED.

ZACH: Strip D&D! Fuck yeah!

MASTER: SILENCE! CHUN LI! ROUND 1! FIGHT!

CHUNLI enters, doing high kicks and stuff.

EMORY: Fireball! (Uses Bill’s fireball shooter)

CHUNLI is not affected, because that thing does no damage. She kicks him in the stomach.

MASTER: CHUNLI WINS! DISROBE, YOU SCABEROUS ANAL BOIL. DID I SAY YOU KEVIN? NO I DID NOT.

EMORY gets naked.

EMORY: (Hits inhaler)

KEVIN: My turn. I’m next.

MASTER: I WILL FILL THAT INSOLENT MOUTH WITH UNSPEAKABLE FLUIDS. YOU! (points to ZACH) PREPARE YOURSELF! STARMAN, ATTACK!

STARMAN enters.

STARMAN: I don’t know who I am and neither does the audience, probably!

ZACH: Easy. I swing my broadsword!

STARMAN: For all you know, I’m invulnerable to that! Hiyaa! (Bodyslams ZACH)
MASTER: A WINNER IS YOU, STARMAN! TAKE IT OFF, YOU BLOODLESS, CUMDRINKING, DWARFFUCKER. KEVIN, I WILL TURN THIS TAUNT AROUND IF YOU DON’T CUT THAT SHIT OUT.

ZACH gets naked.

KEVIN: Oh thank God.

MASTER: KEN! DESTROY THIS EXHIBITIONIST TAINTMONGER.

Ken enters.

KEVIN: I surrender! (starts getting naked)

KEN: I am moved to tears by your pacifism. I commit HaraKiri.

Ken stabs himself.

KEVIN: What? No!

MASTER: KEVIN IS THE WINNER! ALL HAIL KEVIN, THE FULLY CLOTHED!

EVERYONE: All hail Kevin, the fully clothed!

KEVIN: No! It’s not right! It’s not—I was supposed to be naked!

MASTER: YOUR SUFFERING AMUSES ME. KEVIN IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT? DO YOU FEEL AS IF THERE IS UNFINISHED BUSINESS?

KEVIN: Yes! Finish me!

MASTER: VERY WELL. BEHOLD THE POWER OF TRUE MAGIC MISSILES! NURSES, FINISH HIM! (Nurses are gloving up).

Nurses employ some sort of vaginal bombardment (blood/tampons?) while shouting “MAGIC MISSILES” repeatedly.

KEVIN: Oh no! My open wounds!

NARRATOR:

Rub a dub dub
Three men in a tub
Who do you think they be?
The hipster, the hipster
And then another hipster
Plus a robot all sailing to sea.

Three men and a robot walking towards first base lathering each other up in a boat. They are stopped by a SALESPERSON.

SALESPERSON: Stay awhile and listen! Many dangers await you on the open sea. A wise traveller would purchase a PowerGlove to stay safe.

SCOTTY: We don’t need your PowerGlove! We have the REMEMBERBOT3000! It helps even our boozeaddled brains remember even the simplest objects! Like the Platonic solids! REMEMBERBOT, tell me what I REALLY need on this journey!

(REMEMBERBOT hands FERGIE a slip of paper)

FERGIE: “All we need is love?” Come on! REMEMBERBOT, that’s how I got HIV! Well maybe if I’d remembered to wear a PowerGlove I wouldn’t have! What about our summer product line?

(REMEMBERBOT hands ANDY a second slip of paper)

FERGIE: That’s better. The Urethra Hydrant! It puts Magic back in your Missile! Oh god Magic’s Johnson got HIV too.

SALESPERSON: I don’t see how that will help you.

MATT: Too soon? It’s been 20 years and he’s still alive.

SCOTTY: But it turns a young man’s diet squirt into Black Ice!

CAR CRASH HAPPENS. DRIVER HONKS AND TURNS ON EMERGENCY FLASHERS. VERY IMPORTANT: ALL MEMBERS OF 1UP MUST ENFORCE THE CROWD SO THAT EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE NOT CALLED. FIND ANYONE WITH A PHONE OUT AND SHUT IT DOWN. Andy gets hit by car. Collapses in road, spits up blood. MATT and SALESPERSON bring everyone over.

JOE carries provides support to ANDY and they walk towards the audience. When things look particularly bad, JOE and ANDY pull out scripts.
ANDY: (Coughing up blood) Have you ever been hit by a car? I know I have. Do you have a DUI? I know some of you do.

JOE: And some of you have restraining orders.

ANDY: And if you were that guy that just hit me, you could be on the hook for hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills.

JOE: And is that fair? Promoterboat probably thinks they can provide acceptable legal services.

ANDY: But they can’t. They can’t provide any services. Or play kickball.

JOE: We also provide taunt planning services.

ANDY: Is your taunt a mess?

JOE: Do you feel like you’re doing the same taunt over and over again?

ANDY: You need professionals. Call the offices of 1UP yours today.

JOE: You can’t go back in time every week.

ANDY: Or hire a marching band again.

JOE: And now getting hit by a car is played out as well.

ANDY: We got your taunts right here, assholes. Taunts for every occasion. Weddings, anniversaries, funerals…

JOE: So the next time you need legal representation…

ANDY: Or help with your next big taunt…

JOE: Please. Think of your family. And think of us.

ANDY: Stick one up theirs with 1UP Yours.

(ONE! UP YOURS!)

END SCENE**


all the old taunting on the field
it goes on too long don’t you know
they think too slow
(oh way oh)
it turns out that your mom is a ‘ho

we win our taunts on song and dance
and have the cutest dog on the field
you can play kickball
(oh way oh)
can you do anything else at all

you write for a collectible card game
(way oh way oh way oh way ohhh)
taunt like an Egyptian

(breakdown, enter pyramid pasties for second verse?)(so during this breakdown, we could possibly make up an amazing chorus dance for everyone?!?)

team isis said in reverse
is “sissy meat”
have you thought of that
think you’ve got us beat
(oh way oh)
but bad guys lost their game to ball street

Last week we saw your taunting skills
Just kidding HA those were Eric's Balls (this is when whoever plays Eric comes out with a homemade diaper and is willing to drop trow in front of everyone?)                                                                                                                                                                                         
What's up with that?
(oh way oh)
It still doesn't beat all our sexy cats (this is when the girls/guys come out with pasties or bathing suits or whatever and then join our dance. I have a large size keyboard we can use for this taunt, btw) 


way to find one guy that could write taunts
(way oh way oh way oh way ohhh)
taunt like an Egyptian




 (SCENE OPENS: We find ourselves backstage at the WKL halftime show, Ballshankers are placing huge props in positions, the Spirit of 70 Kicks kids are directing the action. There are dressing rooms stage right, the back of the theater center, and craft services etc stage left. There is a whirlwind of action going on. Cases being moved stage left and stage right, large props being put into place etc.)
[SECURITY GUARD PIRATES, obviously drunk, stage left]
MERMAID:	Sooooo, a blumpkin is what now?
PIRATE:	It’s when a guy is getting a blowie from a girl while taking a deuce. 
MERMAID:	So what’s it called when a girl is taking the number 2? Is that a reverse blumpkin?
PIRATE:	No, that’s blumpalingus. A reverse blumpkin is when the one taking the shit is going down on the other one.
MERMAID:	Matey, that’s disgusting! What kind of sick pervert would even think about something like that, let alone write it into a taunt? 
PIRATE (staring at the audience):	Only the most depraved motherfucker in the entire league.
[Enter through curtains: TRICIA with TWO BALLSHANKERS (BABY KYLE and TARA), TINA, and DANNY STORIES (DANNY and TINA have clipboards and headsets).
TRICIA: 	Security! What is the story here?!? I was told there’d be pirates, mermaids, AND seamen.
PIRATE:	Semen is coming soon, baby.
[PIRATE and MERMAID walk off and enter dressing room]
TRICIA:	No! NO! NO Ballshankers! The Golden Shower goes INSIDE the watersports pool. The slip and slide needs to feed OUT OF the pool! Strike ONE ball shank! Prison labor just ain’t what it used to be, am I right? Okay everyone, come together, and yes I am aware that is what she said. It’s 10 minutes until DIVAs take the stage for the WKL halftime show. I want you all to be professional, happy, and perfect. I expect nothing less. DANNY STORIES!
DANNY: 	Yes Tricia, my dear?
TRICIA: 	Headset please. (DANNY hands TRICIA her headset.) PLACES, LET’S DO THIS PEOPLE!
[Enter ANDY WHOREBALLS with a gaggle of DIVAS, ANDY is taking pictures of the DIVAS]
ANDY: 	Oh, fabulous, beautiful, make love to my lens.
TRICIA: 	MRWhoreballs, I believe we are ready for you.
[ANDY and DIVAS look through curtains to look at stage.]
ANDY: 	No, no no no no no no. This is all wrong.
MADONNA:	Yeah, where is my giant golden pyramid made of beer cans?
TRICIA: 	Uh, we never spoke about a pyramid...
LEMMY: 	Where is my skull that shoots snakes out of the eyes, and the snakes that shoot lasers out of THEIR eyes?
TRICIA: 	Skull what?
ANDY: 	Yeah, and where is LADY GAGA? What the Hell TRICIA? I hired you because you are the most competent person in the whole freaking league, and you screw all this up?
TRICIA: 	MRWhoreballs, I swear we never spoke about any of this.
ANDY: 	You didn’t get the email? That other script was garbage, so I wrote my magnum opus at 3am last night. Here’s the new script.. 
[One of the DIVAS hands TRICIA a stack of papers. GAGA enters and examines the craft services table.]
LADYGAGA: 	ANDY, We have a huge problem.
ANDY: 	What is it my muse?
GAGA: 	I FOUND A GODDAMN GREEN M&M IN THE M&M BOWL! You know how green M&Ms killed my mother!
MADONNA:	That’s it! I can’t work under these conditions!
[All the DIVAs freak out and go to their dressing room, during this move LADY GAGA walks center stage to yell at TRICIA and gets lifted in the air by mischievous GNOMES. Tricia is busy with the script and doesn’t see Gaga coming toward her.]
GAGA:	Seriously, this is completely unacceptable. Do you hear me? I mean, I am a fucking professional and I expect this fucking crew to be fucking fabulous. Why, when I was coming up in this business...
[GAGA is getting hoisted up and not really noticing but still just bitching and carrying on. No one notices]
ANDY: 	Well shit, TRICIA. You better figure this out. I’m going to use this time to get the rest of my awkward minutes in. I mean, when else am I going to have the entire WKL in one place? I still have like half the league to get through. (starts filming the audience)
TRICIA: 	Ok, Christ. (looking at the taunt) Baby Kyle, Tara,, get over here. We’re going to have to completely rebuild everything.
BABYKYLE: 	I’m not the baby anymore, Tricia. I am Big Boy Kyle and I hate doing taunts, taunts are the worst. We even threw our last taunt to avoid this bullshit.
TARA:	We have to Baby..er..uh...Big Boy Kyle. Do you want to go back in the hole?
BABYKYLE: 	I want to get back in your
TRICIA: 	NO! Just get back to work. DANNY STORIES, I need you two to go out there and entertain the crowd for like 5 minutes. We need to buy some time so we can fluff the Divas and get them ready to perform.
DANNY: 	Sure thing TMoney. How about we sing a song, like I Wanna Fuck the French All Night?
TRICIA: 	No, no more old throwback jokes, Tina has decided they’re lame. Do something from this year.
DANNY: 	Yeah, but we didn’t write ANY memorable songs this year.
TRICIA: 	I DON’T CARE. Just get your skinny ass out there and kill some time.
GAGA:	I could sing Paparazzi! (no one hears her)
(Enter Nerd Alerter, ISAAC, along with TINA, holding the laser, giant nerf or water gun with ribbons attached)
ISAAC	TRICIA! TRICIA, I have the solution to all your problems. Laaaaaaaaaasers!
TRICIA: 	Lasers? Guys, this is a daytime show, you can’t see lasers out there!
ISAAC: 	Don’t worry. I’m an expert. You see, we use ultra violet light that passes through a quartz crystal with 1.21 gigawatts of luminescent colorful light. Watch!
(ISSAC points laser at crowd. Three or four ribbons of extreme length (100ft) are shot over the crowd.)
TINA: 	Holy Revolutionary War! That’s amazing! But how...
ISAAC: 	Shh. (Puts finger on TINA’S mouth) I’m mansplaining.  So the first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore H. Maiman and was based on theoretical work by
TINA: 	Talk NERDY to ME! I wanna put that tongue to good use.
(TINA drags ISAAC offstage. Laser is left on stage to cause unexpected mayhem in the future)
TRICIA: 	OK folks, [checks watch] 4 minutes until DIVAs are on! 
DANNY:	Tricia I’m getting killed out here. I need some help.
TRICIA:	FUCK! We need something really dreamy to bewitch the crowd and keep them pacified.
ANTHONY:	Did someone say... dreamy? 	
[SOUNDFX “PONY” by GINUWINE. ENTER ZACH and ANTHONY, who start doing strip routine]
ZACH:	We’re an stripper improv troupe. I call it… Stripprov! 
ANDY:				Show me your tumescent phallus!
ZACH: 				My what?
ANDY:				Your engorged member.
ANTHONY:			Come again?
ANDY:				Your wang! Show me your wang!
ANTHONY:	Gladly!
[Anthony rips off pants and reveals a eggplant in a strapon and gets all up on Tricia.]
TRICIA:	This dream is turning into a nightmare!
ZACH:	Yes, aaaaaaand… 
TRICIA:	Whatever. I’ll take what I can get. Get out there and wow that crowd.
[Zach leaves eggplant on craft services table as the Dreamers go on stage]
ANDY:	Tricia, darling, I need to speak to Gaga about the third act. Have you seen her?
GAGA: 	Guys, I am right here! (no one hears her)
TRICIA: 	No I haven’t seen her. (Tricia exits offstage, looking for Gaga)
ANDY: 	Gee Willikers, we have a real mystery on our hands. We need a private dick to solve this caper.
[Enter DON and KENA]
KENA:	Did someone say mystery?
DON: 	Did someone say dick?
ANDY:	Are you detectives?
DON: 	No, we’re the DONtectives. Get it?
EVERYONE:	DoooonDONDONDON! (Dragnet first measure)
ANDY:	We don’t have time for terrible jokes, I need you to find Lady Gaga, stat!
GAGA:	Hey, seriously cats, I’m right up here you’re like staring right at my junk. [Only Kena hears her]
KENA:	There she is!
DON:	Hush Kena! I need to think and gather some clues…. 
[DON starts looking around the set for clues Kena follows shaking her head, both exit stage. Dreamers come backstage after their performance, exit offstage]
DANNY:	Well, that was...one awkward minute....we need another act to keep the crowd entertained. Send me more talent! 
[EMO enter wearing happy face emoji masks]
EMO#1:	MRWhoreballs, I know we’ve been trying to get it together all season but I swear, we got a real, superoriginal song to share with you!
ANDY:	OK, you’ve got 30 seconds to impress me and it better not be awkward.
ALLEMOS:	Everybody hurts…. All the time.. Everybody (Sung to REM)
ANDY:	Cut! Shut it down. This is the final tauntdown. [GNOMES hum “THE FINAL COUNTDOWN” for a second.] The show must be uplifting, amusing, transcendent, an ode to the triumphs of humanity! None of that wackass depressing shit on my stage. 	Emojis, please see yourself out. Thanks guys, but try again next year. You’ll get it eventually.
[EMOS melt into slugs saying SLUUUUUGGGGGGGGG]
[Enter DINO on stage and DINO HANDLER. TRICIA reenters from different dressing room, ANDY goes back to filming one awkward minutes in crowd]
TRICIA:	I’ve looked everywhere and still can’t find Gaga. She’s gone! Just like Hastings right nut.
GAGA:	Still dangling up here. Shrug emoji. (no one hears her)
[GAGA is handed the “Hastings Disclaimer Sign” BALLSHANKERS come on stage pushing road case and see the laser gun.]
DINOHANDLER:	What’s up boss? Where you want this Dino? 
TRICIA:	What do we want with dinos? They’re dangerous and just get less funny every year.
DINOHANDLER:	But everyone loves dinos!
TRICIA:	It’s fine, just make sure we don’t have a Jurassicly bad situation.
DINOHANDLER: 	Sure thing, boss! Dinos are great, as long as you keep an eye on them.
[TRICIA exits. BALLSHANKER picks up laser gun and accidentally shoots Dino Handler in the eye. BALLSHANKERS get scared and run off stage.] 
DINO HANDLER:		Oh no! I’m blind! 
[Dino Handler drops DINO leash. Puts on sunglasses, catches cane that a Ballshanker throws, walks off.  DINO makes his way to craft services table and starts getting snacky.]
GAGA:				Well, that was a sobering moment.
[GNOMES peek their heads out of the road cases and find GAGA and get her high with the bong.]
GNOMES:	HEHEHEHEHE!!!!
[GNOMES get GAGA high with the giant bong.] 			
GNOMES:			HA HA HA TOKER FACE, HA HA TOKER FACE!!!! [sung to the 
tune of Poker Face] 
[TRICIA comes backstage from a dressing room]
[Enter DONTECTIVE and KENA]
TRICIA: 	It’s almost showtime. Dontectives, WHERE THE FUCK IS GAGA!!!!???
GAGA:	I’m high above you!!!
DONTECTIVE:	Searching up and down, but still no leads.
[Exit DONTECTIVE with KENA pointing directly at GAGA and shaking her head]
TRICIA:	Where the hell is GAGA?!?!? Gnomes, shouldn’t you be doing something?
GNOMES:	We are just getting baked and having a good time.
GNOME#1:	Then we’re going to get shit housed and drive gnome!
GNOME#2:	No, we’re not going drive gnome, we’re going to use Gnomer, it’s a rideshare app that is also the last possible gnome pun! We did it gnomes, we went through all the gnome puns! Every single one!
TRICIA:	SECURITY!
GNOME#1:	Cheese it guys, it’s the fuzz!  (EXIT GNOMES)
TRICIA:	Alright Crew, everyone get back here [All characters stay or come back on stage, except Danny and Gnomes  need Dontective, Kena, Dino Handler, all Divas]. I have had just about enough. We need to pull our shit together, find Lady Gaga, and nail this halftime show. It’s time for us to all be consummate professionals.
[PMS sex sounds interrupt Tricia’s speech, kicking off the Rube Goldberg effect.]
RUBE GOLDBERG ORDER OF FUCKERY:
In the middle of Tricia’s speech, sex sounds interrupt. wall/doors falls down revealing PMS sex
Tricia backs up, trips over Emoji slug on floor, accidentally pulling down the curtain
Danny runs in and accidentally stomps on Dino’s tail
Gnome pops back onstage and pies Tricia
Throw a drink in someones face or spit take
Dino reacts flips table
Finally, now that all the set is ruined, now Dontective can finally see GAGA!
DONTECTIVE:	Ahha! I found her. There she is! 
KENA:	(sarcastically) Your Dontective skills are as sharp as ever. 
TRICIA:	This is a complete shit show. Good luck with your disaster DIVAs!
[Tricia throws down the script and walks off]
ANDY:	Disaster is our element, DIVAS, MOUNT UP! Do you want to know my artistic vision? The shit show is my vision. Do you want to know what D.I.V.A. stands for? So do I! Our set is destroyed, but that is OK because the show must go on, for these beautiful people (points with both hands to the real audience). This season has been a beautiful shit show, and it’s thanks to all of you.
[DIVAS enter. All DIVAS go on stage do song and dance number.]
ANDY:	Hit it Divas! ...One, two, three, four!
DIVAS:	Young man, there's no need to feel down.
I said, woman, pick yourself off the ground.
I said, young man, 'cause you're in a new town
There's no need to be unhappy.
Woman, there's a league you can join.
I said, young men, we'll aim jokes at your groin.
You can play there, and I'm sure you will find
Many ways to have a good time.
DoubleUKL 
It’s fun to play in the DoubleUKL 
You can write the best jokes
You can take all the tokes
You can get drunk at every game
It's fun to play in the DoubleUKL...

[Divas walk off, except gaga, obviously]
GAGA:	Ok, taunts over, can you get me down?

FIN




Open on a class taught by SCORPION. Chalkboard says “History.”

SCORPION: Good morning freshmen, and welcome to History 101. Timmy why the fuck are you dressed as a Roman? Why are you all dressed as Romans?

TIMMY: We have a kickball game today!

JIMBO: Our kickballs will blot out the sun!

SCORPION: Then 1Up Yours will catch fly balls in the shade. And that is an explicit reference to the Battle of Thermopylae between Sparta and the Persians, so again, why are you dressed as Roman senators?

TIMMY: This! Is! Kickball! We’re mighty warriors who also have all kinds of gay sex!

SCORPION: CHILDREN! I don’t know where you heard that, but let me assure you: that joke is a product of some lazy, drunken writing. I’d rather watch all of Michael Bay’s films in a row than hear another gay kickball joke.

JIMBO: We take orders from our Emperor, Penicus Maximus!

SCORPION: Jimbo, go outside and eat paint chips until you’re too dumb to talk. As you all know, This Is Kickball is a parody of Spartan society. The Spartans had no empire! They were a militaristic civilization led by two kings who were advised by a body of elders. And have you ever seen Greek and Roman sculpture? The men of This Is Kickball are obviously equipped for battle but not for the bedroom.

TIMMY: Not for the bedroom? But check out this sweet toga.

SCORPION: (Getting frustrated) Yet again, you’re thinking of the Roman Empire you inbred fucks. The Greeks were attired primarily in a garment known as the chiton. Christ. (Lights cigarette)

JIMBO: Hey, MRSCORPION, you’re not allowed to smoke in here!

SCORPION: Well you’re not allowed to shit yourself in here, but that didn’t stop you last week, now did it? The reality is, the Spartans invented a game called sphairomachia. Literally translated, this means “ball battle” and according to Pausanias, it was nothing like kickball. In fact, the Spartans themselves lost their athletic dominance in the 6th century BCE, when…

(GREEK CHORUS enters, wearing togas, probably. In the background, SCORPION is giving a tremendously animated but silent explanation of Greek history, complete with writing various words on the chalkboard, maybe drawing penises also.)

PHYSICAL COMEDY OUTLINE

Unfurl map. Circle Greece. Circle Rome. Draw arrows and write “Rome” and “Greece.” Timeline of GreekRoman things.

CHORUS—

I’m the Greek chorus, a dramatic tool
Here to distract you from this scene in a school

They’ve told us much that is perplexing
When all we sought were tales of sexing

But they’ve forgotten what people want in a skit
Cunts, taints, buttsex, and that sort of shit

Perhaps there’s still time to avoid overthinking
By adding a scene predicated on drinking

So now we’ll observe as a plumber we love
Drinks all the liquor we’re capable of

SCORPION: (coming back from silence) …institutionalized pederasty, which was arguably a cohesive force in this society, so you see—

(MARIO enters)

MARIO: This Is Kickball! I challenge you to a boat race. Down the river Styx! Everyone, put coins on your eyes!

(Boat race ensues. Two boats, one for This Is Kickball, one for us. Only our boat moves. “Come Sail Away” plays. We win the boat race.)

MARIO: To the Elysian fields! One! (Up Yours!)

NARRATOR: It was the roaring 1920s and the liquor apocalypse had descended across the land. The puritanical forces of antifun had pushed through their diabolical act known as "prohibition," barring the sale of any and all alcoholic beverages, and also PBR. As society rapidly collapsed from the pangs of delerium tremens, it was clear that only one kickball team would benefit from the alcopocalypse: Capowned, run by Sam Ali Capone and Tony "Headlock" Monaco, which flooded the streets of Seattle with the shittiest liquor they could provide. Livers and vision failed across the city from their deadly mix of rail gin and methanol while they sat back and raked in the cash... until two women got their revenge.
CHORUS: Taunt. Bunt. Kick. Uh Oh. Alcohol. Pop fly.
LADIES: The end is coming
The end is coming
And prohibition is to blame
How will I think now? Without my drink now?
You know that kickball won’t be the same.
KICK
There was this guy. His name was Sam Ali Capowned. After the game on Thursday he asked, “Hey sweets you wanna get a little moonshine with me?” So I says, “Oh my, that’s against the law, Al Capone, or Ali Caponwed, I mean.” Well obviously, that upset me. I’m a lawabiding woman. So I set his penitent ass on fire.
LADIES: 
The end is coming
The end is coming
And prohibition is to blame
How will I think now? Without my drink now?
You know that kickball won’t be the same.
TAUNT
I knew a guy named Tony “Small Features” Monaco. I was drinking at the 9 Mil and he bought me a drink. I said “I was just a small town girl”. One thing led to another, and soon, we were in the bathroom, and things were getting real hot and heavy. But then he wrapped his hands around my neck and said, “Don’t stop believing!” So I drowned him in a urinal. And then, inexplicably, the zombies came.
EVERYONE: We’ll drink some Rum rum rum rum rum!
We’ll drink some Rum rum rum rum rum!
ZOMBIES
BRAINS!
 ZOMBIELADIES: The end is coming
The end is coming
I’d like to eat all of your brains
The frontal cortex
The cerebellum
It turns out that it all tastes the same!
BILL: Oh shit kids. You just got… APOCAPOWNED! (FIREWORKS)



Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling
Can you picture this?

Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like 
When doves cry

Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other?

(SCENE opens with fergie onstage, sitting cross legged, sobbing. Scottie and Vanessa enter.)
SCOTTIE:	Hey there Fergy, what’s wrong?
FERGIE (sobbing):	Our team is terrible at kickball, we haven’t won a single game this year. And now Isaac says we can’t be in the taunt finals unless we win at least one game.
VANESSA:	Oh little buddy, that is really tough. We were in the same boat… until we went to the upside down and learned the secrets of kickball greatness.
FERGIE (concerned):	You what?
SCOTTIE:	Yeah, we found the God of Kickball and he taught us how to both kick and catch balls.
VANESSA:	That’s right, we’re going to kick your ass today. It’s going to be like 99 to 0.
FERGIE:	Nooooooooooo! How can we get to the upside down?
SCOTTIE (leaving):	It’s easy, just do an upside downward dog pose.
(Rangers exit. Other gods enter)
FERGIE:	Guys, we have to go to the upside down to learn how to actually play kickball!
LEIF:		We’re just desperate enough, let’s do it!
(All gods do an upside downward dog pose and are now in the upside down now)
AGATA:	Wow, it’s so dark and scary here, what’s that sound.
(Callie enters)
ALL GODS:	CALLIE?!
CALLIE:	Oh my god, I’ve been stuck down here since the end of last season. It totally blows.
CYRIL:	You came down here last season to learn how to play kickball?
CALLIE:	Learn how to play kickball? Don’t be stupid. The only reason you come to the upside down is to get eaten by monsters and DIE!
SWETA:	Then why are YOU here?
CALLIE:	Bad tinder date.
ALL GODS:	Ohhhhhh
(Cali exits. Fergie starts sobbing again.)
FERGIE (sobbing):	I’m sorry everyone, I guess I got duped again.
LEIF:		Meh, don’t worry about it. But since we’re all here together we might as well write our Ranger Things taunt. Let’s spitball some ideas.
SWETA:	Okay, how about we have sex on the field?
ALL GODS:	NOOOOOOO!
AGATA:	I got it guys! We do Ranger Manger where the rangers are jesus. That’ll kill.
ALL GODS:	Ughhhhh..
FERGIE:	What if we do Power Ranger Things? With something about the abuse of power?
ALL GODS:	Bleeeech.
CYRIL:	Everyone stop. What is going on with all these horrible ideas?
LEIF:		It’s the upside down, we must be shitty at taunt writing  here.
FERGIE:	Oh my god. What are we going to do? We’re completely out of time to taunt Ranger Things. I mean, we are literally doing it right now.
(Pause)
SWETA:	Well, Agata and I have this taunt AI bot we wrote. 
LEIF:		What?
AGATA:	Yeah, it’s called Deus ex Machina, you just load all your best taunt scripts into it, hit a button, and it spits out a new taunt based on your proven taunt formulas.
CYRIL:	Well at this point we have no choice. Give us a new taunt
(Sweta and Agata work on a computer)
SOUNDFX:	Computer and dot matrix printer sounds.
(Sweta and Agata hand out scripts)

 Fergie: 	I expected an army! What’s the root cause of my uber ride?
 Sweta:  	The whores are alive with the guillotine. Then throw it into a clam! we need our booze, drugs and fun!
Fergie: 	okay, now you spin icon, get out of the fucking rope. Jeeezus you’re getting together. Oh it’s abs one by one. They said something about a serious problem plaguing the galaxy. We all fallen to the boat.
Sweta:    	you hear that?
Leif: 		what, the letter m? For like 3 seconds and see what we did, oh shit, Nelly Furtado, what’s me hear you make bathtime?
Announcer:	[(smoke) takes off one table cloth.]
EVERYONE: 	PENIS!
Rose: 		yeah, ever since the free Cascadian beer wars the replicators can only make triplehopped black IPA. But how about all of the pirate? Sit down on a beer run. Rear admiral b’ahymen just finished off the last one and we we’re gonna lose commie Scottie
Leif: 		you know, since you gotta be handy with stiletto heels if you miss windows 10 so bad… here’s a dicktater
EVERYONE: 	[said in slow motion speech] yeahhhh, thaaat’s double mocks flying.
Fergie: 	sex in the league, er, camp. Camp counselor, can you tell me a little bdsm? 
Jonathan:	Now first off, you already have it. So please laugh loud or you will be your guide. He, he, he’s sake.
 Sweta:   	 I’ll stop Scottie! That’s face, it means you’re killing me here (spoiler alert) now, you're a hiller, your favorite song is way too easy
 EVERYONE: 	no, no, no
 Nancy:    	hey guys, the verse and everyone else on stage left, dive right into the pundergnome. Somehow, this is about me
 EVERYONE:    	comedrops on titties and whiskers on pussies,  tight moistened sphincters on warm virgin tushies,  discrete paper packages tied up with a giant sun,  with all dons don, don, dondon!
Jonathan:	And scene
ANNOUNCER:	This taunt has been brought to you by the coding prowess of Agata and Sweta’s taunt writing bot. Yes, they really did program a taunt writing bot.
(FIN)


(SCENE OPENS: Hamish and Fergie enter)
HAMISH:	DaDa, i wanna go kickball and do a taunt!
FERGS:	Sorry Hamish I can’t let you be in our taunt, some people… (cough) Brandon (cough) are still butthurt about your amazing dancing skills from our taunt against the Gnomes last year. 
HAMISH:	You’re a bad dad.
FERGS: 	I know.  Here’s some cotton candy, stay here for a bit and watch your cartoons, Daddy’s got god’s work to do.
TRICIA:	YOU DAMMIT FERGS, COTTON CANDY WASN’T IN THE DEAL.

Jazzy: Well, the medical team weren't actually doctors…

(SOUNDFX: DUNNDUNNDUNN)

Stage hand holds up sign with “God Eye for the Dead Guy.”

The fab four Gods come on one at a time, do a pose, and then a stage hand holding a sign showing their name and expertise. Herpes: Lifestyle, Billy the Kid Icarus: Fashion, Persyphilis: Grooming, Ringo: ??. Exit to the car (bleachers)

Herpes: 	Okay fab four, what is today’s project?

Billy: 	Today we’re going to help The Kicking dead.

Herpes: 	Kicking Dead, who are they?

Persyphilis: 	They’re the fiercest team on the league, they won the sports last year, with the help of subs from every other team.

Herpes: 	Ahem, not every other team.

(Herpes and Billy high five)

Billy: 	That’s right, they have the hearts they just don’t have the numbers. And this year, they’re going for the braaaaaains.

Everyone (while holding out hands like zombies):	BRAAAAAIIIIIINS 

Persyphilis: 	Don’t get me started on their costumes. Eek. They basically completely ignore rule number 8...

EVERYONE: 	FACE KONTROL!

Persyphilis:	Yes, which clearly states: “Your team needs a uniform, and every member should wear it. "Uniform" can be interpreted how you like, but it should be visible.”

Herpes: 	Now Gods, we all know we have areas where we need coaching. I mean, it took me seven years to learn how to catch a ball.

Billy: 	So how many years into that seven are you?

Herpes: 	Hey, you of all gods should know I’ve got great ball play.

Persyphilis: 	Boys, STAHP! We need to focus on the project. I think we’re pulling up to their kickball field now. Here’s the project sponsor, DJ. Shades.

(Fabfour get out of the car)

DJShades: 	OH, thank us that you are here. As the god of the underworld I really want to love The Kicking Dead. They just make it SO HARD sometimes. Sure they can play kickball, but their costuming and taunt game is hella weak. I want this team in the underworld, but they really should be playing with Underdog.

Herpes: 	Well it sounds like they can really use our help. So let’s get started. I’m Herpes and I head up lifestyle. This is Billy the Kid Icarus, covering fashion. Persyphilis does all our grooming, and of course Ringo Starr, god of rock n’ roll. Let’s start with fashion. Kicking Dead, we’ll need a volunteer.

(Stage hand pulls a Kicking Dead player from the crowd, ideally one who doesn’t have a good costume on)

Billy: 	What is this, shorts and a tshirt with the sleeves removed. Nothing about this screams zombie, but it sure feels dead. Now it really doesn’t take a lot to jizz up your outfit a little bit.

Ringo: 	I think that’s pronounced tszuj, Billy.

Billy: 	No, no, it’s jizz. I know what I’m talking about. Anyways, I really wanted to outfit the entire team in looks inspired by the show. Just check out this pinterest board I created, you could literally wear almost anything but it just needs a little jizzing. However, since I couldn’t go buying individual outfits for everyone I figured out a way to create a look that each of you can customize or add to. 
	
	First, I start with a pack of white tshirts, cut off the sleeves and add a little dye. Remember to save your sleeves because those make great accessories. 
	
	Next, we’ll just take a little spray paint and some stencils and add a little jizzing. 

	For the final touch I even designed you a simple logo. I was inspired by the Dead Kennedy’s logo and how they use the spine of the K and the angles of the DK to create a really strong brandmark. I put together the K and the D from these stencils I had lying around. This simple logo even has a little extra meaning. Notice how the legs of the K create an arrow head toward the D? Much like a fast forward button on your tape player. This logo will show everyone that you’re FASHION forward now!
I call it postapocalyptic urbancamo couture!

DJShades: 	Wow, that IS a real transformation.

Billy: 	And we’ve got one for each of you after the taunt!

Herpes: 	Oh, you’ll look positively devilish now

Persyphilis: 	You’ll be going from the friendzone to the end zone in that outfit.

Ringo: 	Mate, I don’t think there is an endzone in kickball.

Persyphilis: 	Do I look like I play sports?

Herpes: 	Great work Billy. Now it’s time for grooming. Persyphilis, you’re up. Who should we work on....

(Stage hand pulls another Kicking Dead from the audience)

Persyphilis: 	What is up with this skin? It is way too moist. You need boils, blood and mud. Get the mud under your eyes for a ghoulish look. Add some blood to tie it together. And if you don’t have time for all that, just take some this acid peel and spray, delay, and scream away (demonstrates on a god?)

Herpes:  	And if all this can’t help you win then you can always fall back on the one nearly foolproof strategy: bribe the judges. Now the bribing your team has done this season is getting better. Ice cream? Well at least it’s a first, but what did it have to do with your taunt? Remember we’re all drunks, who get together to play kickball and do sketch comedy to mask our raging alcoholism. So let’s make a fun, festive and theme appropriate cocktail. Ringo take it away!

(Ringo puts on a bartenders apron and steps up to a table. Pulls supplies out of a box to make cocktail)

Ringo: 	Alright, hello, it’s me, Ringo!  Time to make a snazzy cocktail, to impress your friends!  Since your team is based on a ever worsening AMC show, with an after show hosted by a sex offender, we’re making a zombie! All right!  Now when making a Zombie it’s really important you use exact measurements, now look over here, i just magically have all ready.  You need one ounce light rum, one oz dark rum, one ounce apricot liqueur, two ounces of orange juice and just a dash of bitters.  There you go little buddy. Mix those together in this cute little shaker, strain over ice, and float some 151 rum on the top.  Garnish with a cherry and an orange slice and ta da.  A delishish zombie. 

(As Ringo makes the cocktail on a table, stagehands make a huge cooler of zombies behind him)


Herpes: 	Okay Kicking Dead, now you’ve received the God Eye for the Dead Guy complete team makeover, and you look, well, better. Now, I know what you’re all thinking:  “But Herpes, there’s only like four games left this season.” True! But take a page out of the Gnome Bible and just reuse the costumes next year when you become “Fear the Kicking Dead”. Well, that’s all for us. Tune in next week when we help the kids from Bayside High get out of their 90’s look.

JUDGE#1:	Welcome to downtown Tokyo, where Cirque du So Lame is continuing their Pacific Rim tour! Today, before we start the show, we’d like you to see the open auditions for our new stage magician! The contestant will go head to head with our magician, the AMAZING “_____”
	(MAGICIAN enters)
ANTHONY:	I’m Anthony “headlock” Monacco, international ninja of leisure. It might surprise some of you to see a ninja auditioning to be a stage magician, but life as a ninja is lonely and I’m ready to join a big family the skill set is surprisingly similar.
	(NINJA enters)
JUDGE#1:	Well then, for the first contest, we thought we’d go with something from the basic magician’s playbook: cutting a woman in half! First we’ll witness the Amazing “____” show us how it’s done.
	(MAGICIAN leads out LADY#1, lies her back on a table, pulls out a saw, saws her in half, then pulls off not-that-sneakily-substituted mannequin legs and shows that they’re cut off, then reattaches them and she leaves the stage.)
MAGICIAN (during):	ABRA… CADABRA!
JUDGE#2:	And now, let’s see the ninja do it!
	(NINJA leads out LADY#2, lies her back on a table, pulls out a katana, then cuts her in half lengthwise. Blood sprays out from her vagina.)
NINJA+LADY#2:	(SCREAMING BACK & FORTH)
LADY#2:	Oh never mind, I just need a tampon.
	(LADY#2 exits.)
JUDGE#1:	Okay… (pun needed here) I don’t think the ninja really got the point of that round. 
JUDGE#2:	For the next trick, we’ve asked the contestants to perform some slight of hand! 
MAGICIAN:	It’s not a trick, it’s an illusion! Tricks are what whores do for money… OR CANDY!
	(MAGICIAN reaches up into armpits, pulls candy from a secret stash, and throws it into audience. Or just grabs it from inside suit pockets.)
NINJA: 	Yeah, that’s what whores do for money… OR CANDY
	(NINJA throws origami ninja stars and fake plastic knives into audience. AUDIENCE MEMBER 1 holds a plastic knife or shuriken up to his eye and pops a blood pack on it and jumps up while blood sprays out.)
AUDIENCE MEMBER 1:	AHHHH MY EYE
NINJA and AUDIENCEMEMBER#1: (SCREAMING BACK AND FORTH)
JUDGE#1:	No, ninja, no ninja NO! Stop killing people!
JUDGE#2:	Alright, for the next round, something that can’t possibly result in maiming… pulling a quarter out of an ear! You sir, will you come up to join us?
	(AUDIENCEMEMBER#2 stands up, and MAGICIAN pulls a quarter out of his ear)
MAGICIAN:	Hold on just a second, you’ve got something there… why, I found a quarter in your ear!
	(NINJA walks up, cuts off AUDIENCEMEMBER#2’s ear, pulls a quarter out of the ear stump.)
NINJA (identical cheerful delivery):	Why, I found a quarter in your ear!
JUDGE#1:	Ninja! The purpose of a circus is to bring smiles to their faces, not dismember them!
NINJA:		You are right… I have brought dishonor to myself, my lord and my family. I must commit… honorable seppuku.
	(NINJA kneels on ground, pulls out sword, tries to stab himself in the stomach, misses and kills magician.)
MAGICIAN:	(Screams)
NINJA:		(Screams)
	(NINJA tries to stab himself in stomach again, but is puzzled as the sword fails to do any damage. JUDGE#1’s stomach bursts open, blood shooting everywhere)
JUDGE#1:	(Screams)
	(NINJA tries to stab himself in stomach again, but is puzzled as the sword fails to do any damage. JUDGE#2’s stomach bursts open, blood shooting everywhere)
JUDGE#2:	(Screams)
NINJA:		Oh man, everyone’s dead! Now I’ll NEVER have an orgy in a circus tent!
	(NINJA throws down smoke bomb.)
NINJA: (sadly) SMOKE BOMB.
	(NINJA walks off to Charlie Brown sad music Arrested Development-style.)

technological faction of the Ferengi which is known for seeking profit
through any means necessary. Delivering books and groceries,
brogramming, launching ships into space, you name it. Next thing you
know, they’ll be delivering hand jobs.
RIKER: ZOINKS?! Did somebody say handjobs?!
AMATHONG#2: You know we can hear you, right? This is a two-way communication, you idiots.
Yes, we are not aligned with the empire. We choose to explore and settle
awesome places, then through the power of douchebaggery, drive up housing
prices and bro them the fuck out. So far we have ruined the entire San
Francisco system, the planets of Capital Hill and Belltown, and we have
determined that our next target… IS FREMONT.

ENTIRECREW: NO! NOT FREMONT!
CAPTAIN: Perhaps if we appease them with gifts for douchebags… Quick, EVERYONE go to

www.amathong.co

SHOCKER: The first choice in immediate gift delivery, forget prime, go PRIME DIRECTIVE for

instant gratification.
RIKER: Did somebody say handjobs?!
CAPTAIN: This guy is really creeping me out, so I’m gonna get a cock-blocker, which the
website says “covers any moist mooseknuckle no matter how large… or small,”
(SOUNDFX: sad trombone. GANGI frowns.)
I’ll choose the “instant delivery by transporter” option.

(Pants suddenly appear around GANGI’s waist.)
GANGI: No, my jager thong! The source of all our—easy easy, them’s my dicks dude!
MRSHOCKER: I just bought a Bro whistle, which according to this site emits a sound that “can
only be heard by the most douchey of douchecanoes.” Here, let me play it for
you.

(MRSHOCKER blows into giant cardboard whistle that looks like a cock &amp; balls. SOUNDFX: DARUDE
- SANDSTORM. AMATHONGS all start fist-dancing in rhythm. REDSHIRT screams in agony and
dies.)
RIKER: Man, that guy was a real douchecanoe.
ENTIRECREW: (laughs uproariously)
CAPTAIN: None of those Amathongians besides Zach have any hair! I’m gonna order them some tribbles.

RIKER: Be careful! Don’t launch them at Emory!
MRSHOCKER: Sir, Emory won’t be able to catch it because he’s not on the team anymore.
CAPTAIN: And Krystal won’t be able to catch it because she’s not on the team anymore.
RIKER: And JEFF won’t be able to catch it because HE’s not on the team anymore!
CAPTAIN: Wow, they just lost all their good players. We actually have a chance of winning this game!

MRSHOCKER: Captain, they did beat Just Bearly 10-3 on Saturday.
CAPTAIN: Yeah, but we did that last year too!
RIKER: Sir, I’m receiving an encrypted transmission on another channel from the
Amathongian vessel. The remaining team members want to defect so they can
finally get back to the taunt finals!

CAPTAIN: Even Starfleet can’t absorb that much dead weight! Fire the BROton torpedo,launch the tribbles, and let’s get the fuck out of here!

(EVERYONE launches tribbles and mardi gras beads into the audience. Aaaaaand scene.)




CAPTAINHEF: Captain’s log. Stardate: Opening Day. Captain Hef here. Master
Beta and DRGusher have joined an away team in the Ur-an-
asshole system of the WKL quadrant. During their mission to
study the primitive beings of this impoverished planet, they
have been captured by a member of the fiendish Begging Cult
led by their charismatic leader Captain Donald Dickbeard.

(SOUNDFX: CULT OF PERSONALITY song plays.)
(The BALLBOYS are carrying kickballs. They carry the balls in front of their crotch and
periodically rub their balls together with the other ballboys. They do this every time
they are not kicking a ball)
(Ballboys start running around for a kickball practice.)

They are chanting:
ALLBALLBOYS: Ballboys! Ballboys!
I kick, I foul, I kick again.
Ballboys! Ballboys!
I kick, I foul, I kick again.

(BALLBOY#3 acts as a pitcher and pitches a kickball to BALLBOY1 who attempts to kick
a kickball and falls on his ass.)
Other BALLBOYS: YAH Ballboys! / Probably Foul / Bleachers! / How do you lay

off that?
DICKBEARD: Mediocre.
(BALLBOY#1 walks off dejected. BALLBOY2 pitches a kickball to BALLBOY#3, who bunts.)
BALLBOY#3: Please sir may I have another win! Please sir! Please sir may I

have a taunt win IN VALHALLA!

DICKBEARD: Even more mediocre. (Slaps ballboy2 across the face.) I SAID NO BUNTS!

(BALLBOY#3 pitches a kickball to BALLBOY2 who kicks a kickball well and runs up to
DICKBEARD looking a response.)
BALLBOY#2: Shiny! Cover me in chrome!
DICKBEARD: BEAR WITNESS! My cult of beggars who beg to beat off bothersome

bands of boys! That’s how you kick a ball!

(BALLBOYS proceed to rub their balls together. BALLBOY1 enters with captured
MasterBeta and DRGusher tied up to each other.)
BALLBOY#1: FATHER! I have captured some fresh blood for the ballboys.
BALLBOY#2: We just got new wives from that mustache cult! We have enough women to field a team!

BALLBOY#3: From one facial hair ride to another. But we could really use some fresh blood.

BALLBOY#1: We need more more more! More help for taunt win! More help for kickball win!

BALLBOY#3: NO MORE LAST IN TAUNTS! NO MORE MEDIOCRE AT KICKBALL! BALLBOYS and DICKBEARD proceed to talk in a cluster but we cannot hear them.
They ignore the Trekkies standing to the side tied up. KENA AND ALICIA sneak out
from behind the tent to talk to the trekkies.)
KENA: Alicia and I thought nothing could be worse than Immortan Luke’s
mustache riding cult, but boy are we regretting that decision. These
guys are all about kicking balls and the dickbeard and everything is
mediocre mediocre mediocre all the time.

ALICIA: WE ARE NOT PROPS! We want to kick our OWN balls!
MASTERBETA (wincing): Ow.
GUSHER: Well, our team is great at taunts and we’re DEFINITELY not mediocre at kickball! Wanna help us escape and join our team?

ALICIA+KENA: YES!
(ALICIA+KENA untie trekkies and they all sneak off into the WAR RIG and leave
the cult. The BALLBOYS realize that the trekkies have escaped and start pointing at
the war rig.)
BALLBOY#1 (shouting): The fresh meat is getting away! No! We’ll never win the taunt now!

DICKBEARD: The wives! They left me! Wasn’t my beard enough for them? How will I field a team?

(Drumming begins with BALLBOY#1 banging on a bucket with a large black dildo.)
CAPTAIN DICKBEARD: Another year, last in taunts. Another year, mediocre at kickball.

(BALLBOYS#2+3 are chasing in slow motion but never catch up to the war
rig. BALLBOY#1 runs after the war rig beating on the drum with a dildo)
BALLBOY#1: What a day! What a lovely BF day!




CAPTAIN: Captain’s log (GROANS, SOUNDFX: POOP SPLASH), stardate eh whatever. The USS Inner Thighs is on an exploratory mission to the planet Neanderball Z in the alpha sigma sigma quadrant, we hear it really rocks down there.

(SOUNDFX: JETSONS THEME, karaoke version. Somebody walks across the stage with
a “MEET THE TREKSONS” sign. Everyone sings their name at the appropriate time.)
PICARD: Jean Lard Picard!
REDSHIRT: Ensign RedShirt!
BETA: MasterBETA!
CHESSA: Chessa, his sex worker!
CAPTAIN: (hits insignia and says “Chirp!”) Captain to the transporter room, 3 to
beam down to Neanderball Z. Somebody say something funny!
CHESSA: Balls!
(SOUNDFX: play the transporter sound. PICARD, REDSHIRT, and BETA do the swim,
in sync, then sneak to the side of the FLINTSTONERS HOUSE where TRICIA is
vacuuming with a dinosaur. CHESSA simultaneously runs off stage in the other
direction.)
(FREDFLINTSTONER ENTERS. All of THE FLINTSTONERS characters act super-stoned
throughout.)
FRED: Hey, Tricia, I’m home.
TRICIA: (startled and somewhat paranoid) What?! Who’s there?!
FRED: It’s your husband, FredFlintstoner.
TRICIA: Whoa, hey, Fred. You’re right on time, it’s 4:20.
FRED: Look what I found on my way home! (holds up huuge ass pot leaf)
TRICIA: That looks like marijuana! JennyRubble and I once ate a whole bunch of that stuff once and we scissored for like, HOURS.

FRED: What’s a scissor?
TRICIA: Eh, it’s a lady cave man thing. How was your day?
FRED: Not bad, me and RobRobble still haven’t invented fire, so we just
stuck Jeff’s Flintstoner “vitamins” up our butts instead. How’s
HamHam?

TRICIA: Oh he’s great, look at the shit he got up to today. (holds an open dirty diaper up)

CAPTAIN: (aside to TREKSONS) It appears that this planet’s technological
progress has been held back thousands of years by some outside
force. Instead of developing advanced technology like a normal
society, all of their equipment is made out of dinosaurs and birds and
really stupid shit. Whoever said this place would rock is a fucking
caveman. Lieutenant MASTER BETA, do your computer brainy
thinking stuff and figure out a way to fix this mess.

MASTERBETA: (stares into space and twitches a couple times): By my calculations,
getting face meltingly high on bubonic hydro chronic is the
cornerstone of every advanced civilization. If we introduce these
neanderballz to the concept of fire, we can restore their society to a
normal progression.

(CAPTAIN and MASTERBETA enter FLINTSTONERS HOUSE)
CAPTAIN: Hi, I just moved in down the street. My name is… Rock… um, Granite…

StonerMcSon. I hear you haven’t invented fire yet?
FRED: No, we’re still just sticking stuff up our butts. Like ya do.
CAPTAIN: Well, my friend here, uh, just invented fire this afternoon. Would you like us to show you how?

TRICIA: Wow, that’d be great! If I have to deal with this lug trying to stick
things up my ass one more night, I’m gonna go Paleolithic on him...

(FRED pulls out a DINOSAUR BONG)
FRED: Here, I made this thing last week from a water-pipe-o-saurus for the
purposes of smoking harmless perfectly legal tobacco. But for the life
of me I don’t know how to make it work.

MASTERBETA: That, Mr Flintstoner, is a singularly peculiar dinosaur bong. But let me

demonstrate how to make… fire!

(MASTERBETA pulls out a GIANT PROP LIGHTER. Fred gasps in aww. MASTERBETA puffs and passes.

ENSIGN REDSHIRT puffs, keels over coughing, then dies.)

MASTERBETA: (without emotion) Captain, this danky-ass caveman kush killed Ensign RedShirt.

(Everyone laughs, including MASTERBETA, because they’re stoned. FRED tokes.)
FRED: Yabba dabba doobie!
SONG NUMBER:
Flintstoners. Meet the Flintstoners.
They're the ancient stoner family.

From the town of Fremont,
They are a page of West Coast history.
Let’s go buy some baked goods down the street
Then we’ll karaoke to the beat
When you're with the Flintstoners
Have a big ol’ sticky joint time.
A fatty blunt time.
We'll have a gay old time.
(END)


(SCENE OPENS: Woodski Diver fake bar setup. Sam as a bartender)
NARRATOR:	Gather round, children, and I’ll tell you the tale of Tinalocks and the three bars. In the magical land of Fremont, right after the festival of losers…
	(TINALOCKS enters the scene, speaks past the audience)
TINALOCKS:	With all this bar-gate I don’t know where to go… if only the WKL had a good bar. I guess I’ll go check out the Woodski Diver.
SOUNDFX:	“HOLY DIVER” plays in background.
NARRATOR:	So a Blinger, a Kneadmore Knocker, and a Goat walk into a bar…
	(A guy from Bling, Kneadmore, and GOAT enter behind TINALOCKS drinking beers and Jaegermeister)
TINALOCKS:	Oh, this bar is so bright! And so broh-ey. Look at all these dudes! I mean, I love all the dudes… but not ALL the dudes.
BLINGER:	Hey Teenz! This bar is amazing! Come check out this shotski with us!
	(BLINGER pulls out tiny shot ski with one shot glass on it.)
TINALOCKS:	That ski is SO TINY! Who is that for, the wee baby Hamish?
KNOCKER:	That ski is about six inches, that’s average length..
TINALOCKS:	Sorry, but three guys one shot glass is TOTALLY not my thing.
	(ENTER PRJ MATT IN TONGUE COSTUME)
PRJ MATT:		Hey, guys, who wants a PACIFIC RIM JOB!
BLINGER, KNOCKER, GOAT (in unison):	I DO! I DO!
	(BLINGER, KNOCKER, and GOAT all bend over and grab their ankles. MATT walks around licking all their butts.)
NARRATOR:	TINALOCKS thought this bar was TOO bright, and TOO bro-ey.
	(TINALOCKS nods in agreement.)
		So she walked across Fremont to check out the High Dubliner.
	(Tarps are dropped to reveal the High Dubliner bar. Mackenzie, Alex, Baby Kyle and a few ANAL Stewardesses are all partying, pretending to be singing and dancing.)
SOUNDFX:	LMAFO SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS
		Where she found a cold, shriveled, sad BFCoC.
LUKE: (like a baby throughout)	A-BOO-HOO-A-HOO! BOO-HOO-HOO-HOO!
TINALOCKS:	It looks like they did something… to your butt!
LUKE:		Those ANALERS! They did something to my butt!
TINALOCKS:	Are you okay?
LUKE:		NO MY BUTT HURTS! I’M BUTT HURT! And now they won’t let me go inside!
TINALOCKS:	Oh, for serious! Why not?
LUKE:		Because I’m… DUUUUUUUMMMMMMBBBB! (crying)
TINALOCKS:	Come on Luke, it doesn’t look like there’s that much fun in there! I mean, there’s just Mackenzie doing body shots off of Alex while baby Kyle is doing a bong rip and stewardesses are getting hot karaoke ANAL action. 
BABY KYLE:	DANG-AH ZONE!
TINALOCKS:	It looks SO GREAT—I mean, boring. Boring and, um, bad.
LUKE:		Yeah, fuck those guys! If they don’t want me, I don’t wanna be there!
NARRATOR:	So since Tinalocks knew that Luke was the MOST IMPORTANT PERSON in the history of the WKL, they went off to find another bar together just for him! Jesus, this IS SO MEAN. I’m mean seriously, what asshole wrote this shit?
(ENTER WRANGLER)
WRANGER:	 Okay everyone, we’ll need you to come around the tents for the second act!
(EVERYONE from the first two bars comes out and holds arrow signs pointing people around the tents. TINALOCKS and LUKE carefully walk along the path to PROBABLY FOUL.)
NARRATOR:	After their long journey Tinalocks and her beefcock finally found a bar that would give them everything their kickball hearts desired.
(Drop all the curtains to PROBABLY FOUL and show the sign. SAM and SCOTTIE are behind the bar)
TINALOCKS:	Oh, this bar looks just right!
SAM:		Welcome to Probably Foul, the greatest bar on earth! Can I get you ladies something to drink?
TINALOCKS:	I’d love some champers, but I’m a little short on cash right now and everybody knows that Luke spent his life savings on cardboard and duct tape.
SAM:		No worries, at Probably Foul we accept payment in raffle tickets and titties as well as cold hard American cash.
TINALOCKS:	Oh I’ve got lots of those!
	(Tinalocks pulls out raffle tickets and rubs breasts)
LUKE:		No Tina save those tantalizing ta-tas and raffle tickets for later, I brought my own.
	(Luke pulls out a PBR from his backpack and starts pouring it into an empty Oly can from the bar)
TINALOCKS:	NO LUKE! Remember what happened last time! And your butt!
SAM:		Don’t worry about it, nobody gets 86ed from Probably Foul!
LUKE:		Oh my god this is the best bar ever!
	(Fergie enters the bar)
EVERYONE:	FERGS!
SAM:		How’s it going Fergie?
FERGIE:	Tricia divorced me and wee baby Hamish is a Sounders fan, get me a beer!
	(SAM hands FERGIE a beer.)
DON MADDOX:	FUCK THE TIMBERS!
GANGI:	Fergie you know, your heartbreak reminds me of the year we were Ballstreet when we were robbed of our threepeat after we were also robbed the year before as Magic Missiles and M.A.R.T.Y. before that. If we had made it to the taunt finals and won all three of those years, we would have had a repeat.
FERGIE:	Yeah Kevin, I get it. Every time you lose a taunt you are totally robbed.
HICKEY:	You know, in psychiatric journalism we refer to that syndrome as badtauntitis.
SCOTTIE: (under breath)	Yeah, you know a lot about bad taunts, Hickey.
HICKEY:	What was that Scottie?
SCOTTIE:	Well, I’m just saying, sometimes your taunts are… you know, a little hit and miss.
HICKEY:	Look Scottie, everyone knows the dynamic of this team. I’m the funny, sexy, charismatic one. And you’re my little bitch.
SCOTTIE (flipping out):	That’s it! I’ve had enough of this bullshit! I QUIT!
	(SCOTTIE storms out of the bar, immediately comes back in and goes to SAM)
SCOTTIE (to SAM):	Hey, uh, Sam, I really miss the spirit of this league and all the great people, and um, I’m a bit short on cash. Can I have my job back?
HICKEY:	This is exactly what I’m talking about Scottie, always crawling back to daddy.
	(SCOTTIE starts checking facebook on his phone.)
TINALOCKS (to Luke):	I don’t know about this bar. It’s getting really awkward. There are a lot of strong personalities here.
SAM:		WAIT! Don’t leave! Probably Foul is the place you want to be. Check out our menu full of kickball themed drinks.
	(SAM points to posted menu and hands printouts to them. TINALOCKS and LUKE looking over menu.)
TINALOCKS:	Mmmmm, Just the Rim sounds delicious, I’ll have one of those.
	(SCOTTIE makes Just the Rim shot)
LUKE:		Well, I really should have joined that circus, so. I’ll have the Lamest Shot on Earth.
	(SAM makes Lamest Shot on Earth)
SAM:		Listen we’ve got it all here at Probably Foul. We’ve got glory holes
	(SOMEONE reveals the glory holes)
SAM:		We have beer pong.
	(SOMEONE reveals beer pong table)
SAM:		We have a stripper pole
	(SOMEONE dances on the stripper pole)
SAM:		We have SIREEL
	(SirEel pops out from behind a wall and heads to the bar for a drink)
SIREEL:	Finally, SOMEBODY said SirEel!
SAM:		And I’m sure you’ve noticed all the WKL memorabilia on the wall.
LUKE:		The ambience is really nice.
TINALOCKS:	This place is amazing, I’ve got to call my friend MrTeenz! Do you happen to have a phone I can use?
SAM: (pulling out red tele)	Honey, we’ve got the best telephone.
	(TINALOCKS acts like she is talking on the phone)
LUKE:		Wow, this is amazing. But I’m getting a little dry here, I think I need another drink.
SAM:		Well why don’t you find 18 friends and take a take a drink from our ridiculously long shot ski.
	(Two people bring the shot ski out. LUKE asks the audience members with tickets to come up and take a drink. Helpers fill up all the shots.)
LUKE:		Say, what's in this drink anyway?
SAM:		This is the Taze Sharri in the ass, it’s something something something and, I don’t know, rum?
	(SOMEONES set up and take the shot ski shots while the action continues.)
TINALOCKS:	Sam, this is almost the perfect WKL bar. But there’s one thing missing. KARAOKE!
SAM:		Oh we’ve got the best karaoke. WKaoke! And guess what, your up next!
	(SOMEONE hands TINALOCKS the microphone. SOMEONE LESE holds up the cardboard lyrics.)
SOUNDFX:	Cheers theme song instrumental (“Sunfly Abraxa” karaoke version from Spotify.)
(FIN)


(SCENE OPENS: ENTER SAM, standing in front of a table with three cups in front of him. The wedding ring is hidden under a marked cup.)
SAM:		Step right up, friends, family, all-night butt sex pilots! I need one volunteer for this fantastic game of chance! Anyone? (works crowd up) Anyone? How about… (points at Tricia.) you. Okay, I’m putting this ball under the middle cup. (does so) Now, whatever you do, keep your eye on the ball…
	(SAM starts to move cups around. Enter FERGIE)
FERGIE:	Sam, I’m taking over from here. Tricia, I’m going to make this easy on you, and hopefully you’ll make it easy on me.
	(FERGIE takes away the two cups that don’t have rings.)
		I think you should pick that one.
	(TRICIA picks the cup, FERGIE gets down on one knee.)
		Tricia, I love you. I love you with all my heart, all my mind, and all my soul. Would you make me the happiest Fergie in the whole wide world and marry me?
TRICIA:	Yes!
	(If TRICIA does not immediately say “yes,” hand her a script with the above line highlighted.)
FERGIE:	Thank you!
	(FERGIE gives Tricia a hug and a smooch.)
		Well, there’s no time like the present, right?
	(FERGIE grabs the bullhorn from under the table.)
		Alright, team, let’s have a wedding. First thing we need is a wedding dress!
	(DREA FERGUSON, CHESSA, POPPA FERGS, and ISABEL come out from the tent and put the veil and wedding dress on TRICIA. Estimate this will take 1.5 minutes.)
FERGIE:	Second, I’ll need a suit!
	(FERGIE rips off tearaway jumpsuit to reveal a wedding suit.)
FERGIE:	Next up, we’ll need an arch, and we’ll need a long pathway down… here!
	(FERGIE gestures down middle of group, audience makes room while SAM unrolls the long roll of paper to form a wedding aisle. LEIF and DANI bring out the wedding arch while CYRIL and JASON moves the table out of the way.)
FERGIE:	Okay, now we need some bridesmaids and groomsmen!
	(BRIDESMAIDS and GROOMS enter from behind the tent—segregated by gender on each side. They line up in traditional positions next to where FERGIE and TRICIA will be standing for the actual ceremony. BRYCE  stays behind.)
FERGIE:	This still isn’t quite wedding-y enough. We need a LOT more family members and friends.
	(Remaining family members and friends enter then stand in front row.)
FERGIE:	Kate! You’ve got flowers, want to be the flower girl? Chessa, help her out with that! Crap! I need a ring for me! Jake, you be the ringbearer, you don’t happen to have one with you do you?
JAKE:		I’ve got a ring pop!
	(FERGIE gestures behind JAKE’S EAR.)
FERGIE:	Hold on just a second, you’ve got something back there… BAM A RING! Okay bud, take that and go hang out with your sister. Now it looks like we have everything we need. Oh shit, we need a priest!
JONATHAN:	I’m not just a neuroscientist, I’m also an ordained minister!
	(JONATHAN rips off tear away robe and reveals priest uniform.)
FERGIE:	How… conveeeeenient. Okay, Tricia, would you mind walking to the top of this aisle? Oh wait, we need someone to walk you back in… Captain Rob?
ROB:		I’d be delighted!
	(FERGIE tosses ROB a bow tie.)
FERGIE:	Okay, let’s do this. MUSIC!
	(MUSIC CUE: “Isn’t She Lovely” by Stevie Wonder)
	(CHESSA and KATE walk down the aisle, flower girling. Jake walks down the aisle with the rings. ROB walks TRICIA down the aisle.)
JONATHAN:	Dearly beloved—and all you kickball jerks—we are gathered here today not only to see the final seedings of the taunt championship, but to join this lovely woman with this… well, with Fergie. Now remember Tricia, it would be socially awkward to back out now, but in the interest of fairness I have to ask if anyone present objects to this union.
	(BRYCE enters from behind the tent.)
BRYCE:	I object! How can you have a shotgun wedding without a shotgun?
	(BRYCE pulls out a PBR and shotguns it. Maybe all of the groomsmen (and any interested bridesmaids) shotgun a PBR as well. Everyone shotguns!)
JONATHAN:	Okay. We good?
BRYCE:	Yeah, we’re good.
JONATHAN:	Alright then, moving forward. It is my pleasure to introduce these two dear friends to the world of matrimonial bliss. (JONATHAN WRITES WEDDING CEREMONY HERE.)
		Now FERGIE, I believe you have prepared vows for the two of you?
	(FERGIE nods. Chris hands FERGIE the scroll, who hands JONATHAN the scroll, who hands it to TRICIA.)
TRICIA (Reading from the scroll):	Michael, you are the father of my child, the love of my life, and my best friend. You are funny, smart, and you have what some cultures could plausibly call the body of a god. I mean, Buddha and Ganesha are gods, right? In all seriousness, this is amazing, and I really never expected this. I love you, and would be so happy to be your wife.
FERGIE:	Well, my vows are more like a list of grievances. KIDDING! Tricia, I love you. I want and would do anything for you and our upcoming son. I love the way you look at the world. I love your dedication to excellence combined with your passion for fun. I love rubbing your feet when they ache. I love the look in your eyes when I make those crack mashed potatoes you love so much. I love you so much I planned a wedding for you, and kept it a secret for four months, all so you wouldn’t have to stress out for your big day.
JONATHAN:	Tricia Marie Jester, do you take Michael Robert Ferguson to be your mostly lawfully wedded husband? Do you promise to love, respect, support, trust and entertain him for as long as you both shall live?
TRICIA:	I do.
JONATHAN:	Michael Robertson Ferguson , do you take Tricia Marie Jester to be your mostly lawfully wedded wife? Do you promise to love, respect, support, trust and entertain her for as long as you both shall live?
FERGIE:	I do.
JONATHAN:	Could you do the thing with the rings?
	(TRICIA+FERGIE do the thing with the rings.)
JONATHAN:	It is now my esteemed pleasure to declare you, pending filing of paperwork sometime in the next week or two, husband and wife. I now present to all those gathered here, MrsTriciaMarieFerguson and MRMichaelRobertFerguson. You may kiss the bride, after which your team may then demolish him on the kickball field.

LEIF:		I’m so exhausted!
DANI:		Yes, we’ve been on tour for seven whole weeks! This schedule is killing me!
LEIF:		Look, there’s a… bread and breastfist? Maybe they have a room we can stay in.
(LEIF+DANI enter BREAD AND BREASTFIST. KEVIN is carefully arranging a baguette between two bread boobs so like he’s titty-fucking them.)
KEVIN:	Welcome to the Bread and Breastfist! What would you like today?
DANI:		Well, we were wondering if we could check out a room.
KEVIN:	Oh, we get that a lot. I don’t know why, because we’re an erotic bakery!
LEIF:		A what?
KEVIN:	We make breads and pastries of the sexiest things—you know bread boobs, dickerdoodles, cakes with grown men breastfeeding off of women…
(KEVIN starts kneading bread while talking, looking like he’s jerking it off)
DANI:		Don’t you have problems with the health department, I mean, preparing food naked all the time…
KEVIN:	No, we don’t have any problems with the law, we follow the utmost standards of behavior. (turns around and grabs a pie with a hole in it full of frosting) Would you like to try our American pie?
LEIF: (disgusted)	No… I think we’re good…
(BEARDEDLADY enters)
KEVIN:	I’m sorry, I’ll be back with you in just a second. (to BEARDED LADY) What would you like today, madam?
BEARDEDLADY:	Just the usual.
(KEVIN grabs the bread boobs from behind them and hands them to BEARDED LADY.)
KEVIN:	Here you go!
(BEARDEDLADY places bread boobs in chest.)
BEARDEDLADY:	Perfect as always! Thanks, man!
(BEARDEDLADY exits. KEVIN goes back to jerking off dough while talking to CIRCUS folks.)
 (Enter FRENCHIE)
FRENCHIE:	Bonjour, mon ami. I would like to purchase your finest baguette!
(KEVIN turns and grabs hot dog.)
KEVIN:	What were you looking for? Will this do?
FRENCHIE:	No, that is too small… (gestures at crotch) I was thinking something more, you know, life size!
(KEVIN grabs Italian bread.)
FRENCHIE:	What is this, a choad? I just want a baguette!
(Kevin grabs baguette.)
KEVIN:	Well how about this?
FRENCHIE:	Just like the real thing! Thank you sir!
(Exit FRENCHIE, enter SHARRI & 2)
SHARRI:	Morning! I’d like your finest cookie please!
KEVIN:	Ah, sorry, we don’t sell that, if you want cookies, you should go to my friend JEFF’s bakery, called, uh, I’m So Fucking High I Can’t Remember.
SAM:	Well, do you know where it is?
KEVIN:	Down the street, just look for the sign!
SHARRI:	(Confused) What does the sign say?
KEVIN:	I’m So Fucking High I Can’t Remember.
SAM:	(To SHARRI) Forget it, this guy is too stoned to do anything.
(Exit SHARRI and 2)
KEVIN:	(Calling after them) No, no, that’s Jeff’s Tacoma location!
LEIF:		So I guess we’d like a couple round loaves please!
KEVIN:	Sorry, I just sold out the last batch. 
DANI:		Well, do you have any breasts then?
KEVIN:	Actually, if you’re looking for a job, we’d like to hire more hooters.
LEIF:		What?
KEVIN:	We’re trying to… acquire some areolas?
DANI:		I’m sorry, I just don’t follow.
KEVIN:	I’m saying that we have a mandate for mammaries! Procure pectoral pillows! Gather some gazongas?
(Someone walks stage with “TEN MINUTES LATER” sign)
DANI:		No seriously, what the fuck are you trying to say?
KEVIN:	Look. Let me make this clear: we’d like to draft some DDs
DANI:		Do you mean you… (makes kneading gesture with hands) need more knockers?
(KEVIN gasps and slaps DANI)
KEVIN:	This is no time for puns! You can do better than that!
LEIF:		Well, you’re out of bread…
(DANI puts on apron)
DANI:		And don’t have any breasts…
LEIF:		So that only leaves one thing…
		(DANI puts on rubber gloves)
DANI:		…we’ll just have to fist you instead!
(KEVIN bends over and moans while DANI punches him in the butt. Maybe customers come back in and fist him with their bread products.)
KEVIN:	Oh, finally! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
 (END)





SOUNDFX: GOOD,BAD,UGLY/PONY MASHUP
Open on dessert scene with music from the Good the Bad and the Ugly playing. Pony is lying dead on the field. High Nooners enter the scene slowly, obviously dying of being stoned. And thirst. Tumble weeds (cardboard marijuana leaves) roll through the scene.
ALEXIS:	God, it’s hot as kickballs out here, I could lick the sweat off of baby Kyle’s balls. Who brought the water?
Nooners all look around at each other, nobody has water.
WHITNEY:	I brought the weed. 
KYLE:		I brought Jeff’s brownies.
ALEXIS:	I brought the pot butter and some mushrooms. 
Everyone turns to Kevin.
KEVIN:		I’ve got some powdered formula if we find some water—oh yeah, I’m really thirsty too.
ALEXIS:	Ahhhh, it’s like a dessert in my mouth. I mean, desert. I’m so thirsty.
KEVIN:		Well we can at least make a sandwich from what we brought.
SOUNDFX: JIMI HENDRIX
(Nooners make a sandwich and pass it around and starts to trip a little. Music gets psychedelic. Jimi Hendrix: All along the Watchtower, Ribbon dancers dance, a swirly spiral sign. Gorilla On Acid Tripping walks by.)
KEVIN:		Damn, the colors…LOOK! Over there! I see something… is it a building?
WHITNEY:	No, it’s a tent!
KEVIN: 	I think it’s a mirage.
WHITNEY: 	No dude, it’s like five feet from us, it’s a tent. Look, I can touch it.
KYLE:		Maybe they have, like, water man.
(Nooners stumble towards the tent. As they approach Sam comes out.)
SAM:		Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls! Step right up!
ALEXIS:	Do you have water?
SAM (ignoring):	We’ve got spectacular spectacles, amazing acts, and fantastic freaks!
KEVIN:		WATER! Please, water! 
SAM (ignoring and stepping aside):	Come enjoy the Cirque du So Lame!
(Vendor steps out with basket of wares.)
VENDOR:	Popcorn! Peanuts! Rock salt!
WHITNEY:	Give us something to DRINK!
VENDOR:	Why didn’t you say something?!? Who needs a drink?!
(Nooners all get excited “ME! ME! ME!” Vendor hands out drinks, and exits Nooners all try to drink but it’s sand, rock salt, cotton and flour and everyone spits it out. Nooners all look frustrated and desperate.)
(Fortuneteller enters.)
FORTUNETELLER:	Find out the secrets of your future with a fortune!
KEVIN:  	When will we get just a drop of water?!?!
(Fortuneteller pulls out kickball and does the crystal ball thing around it.)
(SOUNDFX: SALAD FINGERS)
FORTUNETELLER:	Let’s consult the all-knowing ball… When it’s high moon, your bravery will be tested, your minds will fog, your bowels will be pierced by giant golden peen and THAT is when you’ll meet the wise ancient eye. 
WHITNEY:	Whoa. This is getting really surreal.
Enter SirEel as he walks through the scene. The nooners are all scared/startled. SirEel says nothing.
KYLE: 		It’s getting dark... and look, it’s high moon.
(SOUNDFX: BLUE MOON)
(FERGIE moons the crowd from a ladder. FERGIE puppetrons his ass which is talking to them.)
HIGH MOON: 	Helloooo there Nooners, it’s me Mooners. Hahahahahaha
WHITNEY:	Uhg, my stomach!
KEVIN:		She wasn’t kidding about those giant penises in my bowels. 
HIGHMOON:	NOOOOONERS! You have traveled great distances only to make absolute fools of yourselves. All the water you’ve ever needed has been in front of you the whole time. 
(Someone rises from behind Fergie’s cooler which has been sitting on stage the whole time with sign that says “WATER LOOK HERE”. Nooners pick it up and try to drink from the spout but nothing comes out.)
HIGHMOON:	FOOOOOOOLS. You must look deep insiiiiiide!
(Everyone looks up and points at FERGIE’s butt.)
HIGHMOON:	Are you looking at my assssssss? Seriously guys, this is awkwarrrrrrrrrd. I’m trying to teach you an important lesson heeeeeeeeeeeeere! Stop looking at my ass, look at the water cooler.
(Nooners look confused. Signs with arrows also say “ Look Here”.)
WHITNEY:	I think I get it! Look deep inside!
(Nooners open the cooler and discover water balloons and sabotage the audience)
(SOUNDFX: DESPERATE-RADO)




(Characters enter while giving out Trix flavored Jello shots. They remark that “These Trix are definitely not for kids.” Characters sit down. TOUCANSAM enters carrying “100% ASSHOLE TAUNT” sign and joins rest of the breakfast characters sitting on folding chairs in a circle. Dr.’s Waffle and Chicken enter.)
DRWAFFLE:	Good morning everybody!
BFCOC: (dejected)	Good morning.
DRWAFFLE:	I’m DRBel-Gin Waffles and this is my colleague DRCornelius Chicken.
DRCHICKEN:	Welcome to the Breakfast Anger Management Club. Congratulations on going one whole day without any major outbreaks or getting kicked out of a bar. Would someone like to explain why you are all here?
LUKE:		Oh, I got this. (standing up) I’m tired of the lack of professionalism here. All these winning taunts are just people standing around, reading mechanically off scripts.  There are no good props. No amazing costumes. And barely any of them surpass the magic 6 minute threshold that everyone knows is the minimum length required for a quality taunt. And yet they keep winning. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS LEAGUE?
DIGEM:	Sometimes I get so angry, I just SNAP, CRACKLE, and POP!
LUKE:		Yeah! This place is a fucking circus! You have to be fucking cereal, guys!
 (ENTER CYRIL smoking a joint)
CYRIL:		Did someone say “Cyril”??
LUCKY:	No, sorry, man.
CYRIL:		Awwww…
(CYRIL hand joint to DIG ‘EM FROG.)
DIGEM:	I’m koo-koo for cocoa puff puff pass!
(EXIT CYRIL back into the tent)
DRCHICKEN:	So let’s break this down. “Breakfast Fight Club of Champions.” So breakfast is good, you’re all breakfast foods. Fight club seems problematic, I mean that’s the reason you’re all in therapy. But are you really… “champions”? Have you ever won a championship? Have you ever won a trophy?
DRWAFFLES	DrChicken, I happen to have a trophy right here. Let’s try some immersion therapy. Now this is a trophy for real champions. I think we’re not quite ready for that one.
DRCHICKEN	That’s right. Let’s look at a trophy we can think of as a reachable goal. Now, last year at the festival of losers you placed third in a two-way game. But perhaps if you try very hard, this year you could be the Breakfast Fight Club Champions of Losers, or BFCOCL for short.
DRWAFFLES:	Think of it as a reach-around goal. With just a little—well, a lot of practice, you too could be the best losers. How does that make you feel?
BFCOC:	SO LAME, SO LAME
SUGARBEAR:	Don’t worry doctors, we’re very cereal about this.
(ENTER CYRIL with a palette and brushes or a Dali poster)
CYRIL:		Did someone say “surreal”?
DIGEM:	(Waves finger around her ear and hums circus music.)
CYRIL:		Not again…
(CYRIL exits dejectedly.)
(LUKE jumps out of chair excitedly, grabs the unicorn trophy, tries to escape.)
LUKE:	I CAN’T TAKE IT ANYMORE THIS IS MY ONLY CHANCE! I HAVE WRITTEN LITERALLY HOURS UPON HOURS OF TAUNTS AND SPENT MY LIFE SAVINGS ON CARDBOARD AND DUCT TAPE JUST TO HAVE A GLIMPSE OF THIS MOMENT OF BEAUTIFUL ETERNAL GLORY. I NEED IT. I DESERVE IT. BUT YOU ALL CONTINUE TO DENY WHAT IS RIGHTFULLY MINE. 
(DRWAFFLE slaps LUKE)
DRWAFFLE:	CAP’N CRUNCH snap out of it! This is unacceptable behavior. We have basic social norms here yet somehow you couldn’t manage to follow even those. You are 86’d from the Breakfast Anger Management Club… FOR LIFE!
LUKE:		Not again…
(DrChicken takes the trophy back and Luke angrily storms off, but hides in the background listening in & watching)
DRCHICKEN	I think Cap’n Crunch has demonstrated our problem here. This all boils down to a false superiority complex brought about by a strange obsession with unicorns.
LUCKY: (in Irish accent)	You can’t be cereal!
(ENTER CYRIL in SirEel costume)
CYRIL:		Did somebody say “SirEel”?
SUGARBEAR:	No, Cyril.
(CYRIL angrily rips off his mask and throws it to the ground.)
CYRIL:		Goddammit, you guys!
DRWAFFLE:	But while you’re here, can you put this in a safe place for me?
(DRCHICKEN hands CYRIL the unicorn trophy. EXIT CYRIL as he leaves the field to hide it in someone’s car.)
DRCHICKEN	Now, let’s get back to your name. Is “champions” really the best way to describe your team? Maybe you should try a more achievable goal. Have you considered calling yourselves “The Breakfast Fight Club of Losers”? Perhaps… “The Breakfast Fight Club of Fail Boat?”?
DRWAFFLE:	Or maybe “The Breakfast Fight Club of Chokers?”
(LUKE runs back onto stage enraged and attacks DRWAFFLE)
LUKE:		I’LL SHOW YOU HOW TO CHOKE! 
(DRCHICKEN pulls LUKE off of DRWAFFLE)
DRCHICKEN	HEY LEGGO MY EGGO!
(LUKE attacks DRCHICKEN. DRWAFFLE pulls him off.)
DRWAFFLE:	WE DO NOT CHOKE THE CHICKEN DURING OUR THERAPY SESSIONS!
 (DRWAFFLE tases LUKE. IN THE BUTT. Sharri’s skirt flies up revealing her ass and the probably foul tattoo)
TRIXRABBIT:	Now THAT’S probably foul!
DRCHICKEN	See, this illustrates the problem. I think you all have hypoglycemic anger disorder as a result of your high-sugar diet composed entirely of artificially sweetened cereal—
(EVERYONE looks towards tent.)
DRCHICKEN:	And as a result, I prescribe that you all switch to a heartier, high-protein breakfast that is clearly superior to your shitty breakfast cereals…
DRSWAFFLE+CHICKEN:	…CHICKEN AND WAFFLES!
 (DOCTORS open up tent and unveil chicken and waffles.)
DRWAFFLE:	In fact, this is a prescription for the whole league!



(HICKEY and VERONICA are hanging out. SIGN: JULY 27 2013 (CONFIRM DATE))
HICKEY:	Well that season sucked! We sucked at kickball, we didn’t make the taunt championship, and Scottie quit the team, then joined again, then quit and rejoined again, and that was just last week. Fuck it, let’s just hit the block party.
VERONICA:	Nah, I liked the block party before it was cool, now it’s too mainstream. Fuck, I heard they have Nickelback playing their dubstep album as the headliner this year.
HICKEY:	Hey, I have that on vinyl!
VERONICA:	EXACTLY. You know, I think the problem was that Hilligan’s Island just wasn’t that great a team theme. Gilligan’s Island is too mainstream, we need something more underground!
HICKEY:	You know, white rappers from the Hill are all the rage in France and if we learned one thing today it’s that France is cool, right?
VERONICA:	Yeah yeah! There’s Macklemore, and Vanilla Ice, and Eminem, and, um, Macklemore…
HICKEY:	Well I heard about this awesome white rap music festival on grindr, I mean tinder, I mean MYSPACE! Let’s jump in my rape-mobile I mean my car and check it out!
(VERONICA and HICKEY get in the car)
HICKEY:	So this music festival sounds really great. Everybody’s drinking all the time…
VERONICA:	Are there drugs?
HICKEY:	Yeah there’s a ton of drugs! And I hear everyone there is a real free spirit, people are walking around topless and naked all the time… I even heard there are rides! And people are in costume and wacky outfits ALL THE TIME!
VERONICA:	That sounds great! That’s like everything that the WKL is all about!
HICKEY:	Yeah, this is gonna be the best team theme ever! With this we could win the taunt championship AND the kickball championship!
(VERONICA and HICKEY stop in front of the tent.)
VERONICA:	Wow, this place smells awful!
HICKEY:	Don’t worry, I’m sure it’ll be better once we go inside.
(VERONICA and HICKEY open up the tent and reveal The Gathering of the Juggalos. VIOLENT J walks up)
VIOLENT J:	Yo you don’t look like no family, you look like a bunch of punk-ass not ninjas aka hatatrons!
VERONICA:	Hickey, I have NO FUCKING CLUE what he just said. Isn’t it great? It’s so underground!
HICKEY:	Wait, I’ve got an app for this!
(HICKEY speaks into phone)
		Hello sir, we wish to participate in your festival. It seems very ahead of the curve.
ROBOTVOICE:	Yo yo yo, this shit be cray! Let me all get up in this and take a swig off a some a that there Faygo.
VIOLENTJ:	Yo now you guys in the family. You gotta check out our best ride, the Magical Mystery Magnet Tour. WOOT WOOT FAMILY!
(VERONICA gets on the chairs for the ride)
VIOLENTJ:	Yoyoyo your eyes can be open or closed for miracles, but for this ride they gotta be closed so I’s gonna wrap this dirty jizz sock around your eyes.
(VIOLENTJ blindfolds them with semen encrusted socks)
VIOLENTJ	Yo I’m gonna turn this ride on!
(Two JUGGALOS come up and start shaking their chairs.)
VJ (rapping):	
If hipsters are all that you’ve ever known
Then your kickball taunts ain’t got no flow
So you wanna kickball theme with purpose
Then you wanna join our dark circus

We got beers, Faygo and awesome tits
You want some drugs?
SOMEONE: Have some whippets!
Alright, we kinda just fucked up
Give us a moment we’ll catch back up

You wanna be fresh, dope and tight
Be able to party all fuckin’ night
Put on your chain, come get insane
Juggalos got family runnin in their veins

(Ride comes to an end as JUGGALOS stop shaking chairs. VERONICA takes off her blindfolds.)
HICKEY:	That was amazing! That was awesome! Fantastic!
VERONICA:	Hey, where’s our wallets? Where’s my watch? And where is my shoe?
VIOLENTJ:	Yo, musta been the magnets. How the fuck do they work?
HICKEY:	That sounds totally reasonable. A miracle!
VIOLENTJ:	You lost all your stuff? Tell you what—you’re in the family now, I’ll give you my chains. Put this bling on…
ALL JUGGALOS: (backing off stage, echoing softly)	Bling on… bling on… bling on…
HICKEY: (once Juggalos are gone)	Man, that Macklemore concert was TIGHT!






OPENING: MPAA film trailer-style ratings screen which reads: “The following TAUNT has been certified as 100% BUTT JOKE FREE by the WKL department of weights and measures”
SOUNDFX:	BWAAAAAAAAAA (from Inception)
VOICEOVER:	We all thought aliens would come from outer space, or maybe Mexico, we were wrong.
SOUNDFX:	BWAAAAAAAAAA
VOICEOVER:	We all thought that the aliens would try to exterminate our race.  We were wrong,
SOUNDFX:	BWAAAAAAAAAA
VOICEOVER:	Turns out they just wanted jobs.
SOUNDFX:	Sad trombone.
SOUNDFX:	The office intro music (30 second version).  

Each character walks/skips to center stage doing something cheesy and we have name cards for them a la an actual TV opening sequence.
CTHULHU walks in with title card: “PACIFIC REAL JOB” then starts unpacking desk and continuing to unpack desk while 
The kaiju are standing around the water cooler.
TONGUEAZOR:	So I told the bouncer there’s no need to card me, I’m an extraterrestrial demon who has lived for untold millennia on the edge of space… of course I’m over 21.
DONSBEARD:	Just another example of anti-Kaiju discrimination.  Just because we’re demons who shoot acid out of our pee holes doesn’t mean we don’t have rights.  I mean, I pay my taxes.
TONGUE-A-ZOR:	Tell me about it.
(MITTENS enters)
TONGUEAZOR:	Hey MITTENS, how’s accounting?
MITTENS:	Just clucking perfect.  SANDRA and KRISTY are riding all up on my cloaca [kloh-ey-kuh]. I keep telling them they are not my clucking boss, and I don’t care if they can drift or whatever.
DONSBEARD:	Yeah, those jaegers are GIANT Aaaaaaaass…. 
(CTHULHU holds up the 100% Butt Joke Free sign and shakes head violently and points at the sign)
DONSBEARD:	uh, JERKS. Just because they piloted a giant robot and beat a kaiju to death they think they’re sooo bad.  You know what happens if I beat a human to death? I GO TO FREAKIN’ JAIL!
TONGUEAZOR:	SCREW SANDRA, SCREW KRISTY, FORGET THOSE JAEGERS, I can do their job 100 times better any day of the week.
(ENTER SANDRA AND KRISTY, the drifting Siamese twins)
SANDRA+KRISTY (skipping in sync):     Schlemiel! Schlemazel! Hasenpfeffer, incorporated! (SANDRA and Kristy trip over their own feet)
SANDRA:	What the hell are you lookin’ at you chicken-footed-Kaiju?
KRISTY (doing chicken arms):	Yeah! BAWK-BAWK-BAWK!!! CHICKENNNNNN!!!!!
MITTENS:	HR! HR!!! That’s species-ist! This is a hostile work environment!
SANDRA:	Whatever birdbrain.
KRISTY:		YO! Sick species slam sista! 
SANDRA+KRISTY:	JAEGERS RULE KAIJU DROOL! (They high-five.)
SANDRA+KRISTY dump the water cooler on MITTENS, while yelling JAEGER BOMB!
KRISTY:		Take that cluckface!
SANDRA+KRISTY:	JAEGERS OUT!
(SANDRA+KRISTY leave)
DONSBEARD:	Well, fuuuuuuuuuck me.
MITTENS:	I hate getting wet.
TONGUEAZOR:	Yeah, and guess who’s getting the blame for all this water in the break room…
DON’S BEARD, MITTENS, TONGUEAZOR (in unison):	THE KAIJU.
MITTENS:	Come on, we better start cleaning this up before the boss shows up.  That guy is a HUUGE Dick.
DONSBEARD:	Right? I mean, that man is literally an ENORMOUS PENIS.
TONGUEAZOR:	Aw, c’mon guys, Paul’s cool.
MITTENS:	Shut up dick licker!
(All kaiju begin to clean up the spilled water: TONGUE-A-ZOR uses tongue, DON’S BEARD uses BEARD, and MITTENS just pecks at it with her beak. HUGE DICK WALKS IN. TONGUEAZOR immediately gets excited and starts licking the HUGE DICK.)
DICK:		WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?!
DONSBEARD:	You see the Jaegers came in and--
DICK:		I don’t want to hear excuses.  We need to synergize and prioritize our action items to get our deliverables out on schedule.
TONGUEAZOR:	What the hell does that even mean?
DICK:		Shut the hell up! I’ve been getting JERKED OFF in these meetings all day! You think I want to CUM out here and see you STROKING each other’s egos? I am seriously considering GOING DOWN on HR and—TONGUE-A-ZOR KNOCK THAT OFF! THAT THING FEELS LIKE CARDBOARD.
DON’S BEARD:	Fuck this you guys! I’m quitting this job and running away to join the circus! You with me?
TONGUEAZOR and MITTENS:	Yeah!
Exit DICK and Enter THE RINGMASTER.
RINGMASTER:	Did somebody say… circus? I just happen to represent the Cirque du so Lame, the lamest show on earth. Let me see your resumes. (The Kaiju rip off the first page of the script and hand to him which he looks over) 
RINGMASTER (turning to DONSBEARD):	What are you supposed to be, Fidel Castro? You know Cuba’s not even in the Pacific Ocean, right?
DONSBEARD:	Nope, I’m just a really really really really really REALLY big beard.
RINGMASTER:	Are you a lady?
DONSBEARD:	Nope, just a giant beard.
(Ringmaster, shaking head in obvious disappointment, turns to TONGUEAZOR).
TONGUEAZOR:	So I’m a giant tongue from the deepest darkest abyss of…
RINGMASTER (cutting him off):	Yeah right Wilson, no take-backsies.
(Ringmaster quickly turns to MITTENS)
RINGMASTER:	And you! You’re not even a kaiju! You’re just a chicken.
RINGMASTER (to all three):	You aren’t lame, you’re horrible! You aren’t even lame enough for the lamest show on earth! But you know what? I think we DO have something you can help us out with.
(Rest of the team comes out/gets up and we all huddle together for a sec as if planning what to do then we all get in a line)
EVERYONE:	LET’S ALL GO TO THE BLEACHERS
		LET’S ALL GO TO THE BLEACHERS
		LET’S ALL GO TO THE BLEACHERS
		AND ROOT FOR CIRQUE DU SO LAME!




SCENE RINGMASTER is standing in the tent, with the AUDIENCE off to the side.
RINGMASTER:	You lucky audience members are here for the lamest and greatest show on Earth… Cirque du So Lame! We have all the most fantastic delights that can be seen! You have already encountered the Hula Hoop Dancing Lady, the Lion Tamer, Salami the Kickball Swami, and many many more! But I would like to introduce you to one thing you have not seen, one thing so amazing that none have ever seen it before… TRUTH AND DARE, THE SIAMESE TWIN BEARDED LADIES!
	Enter TRUTH+DARE
TRUTH:	Welcome to our show, ladies and gentlemen! Would you like to play a little game with us? First up, my lovely sister would like to offer one of you a dare. Any volunteers?
	Audience members all start waving their hands and yelling “Me, me!”
DARE:		Yes, you [sir or madam]! Come up and join us!
	CONTESTANT#1 stands and approaches the twins.
DARE:		I have a very simple dare for you… you must… LICK ALL MY NIPPLES!
	DARE pulls dress up or down, reveals like fifty nipples. One of them is lactating. Another one is bleeding.
CONTESTANT#1:	Hey, no problem!
	CONTESTANT#1 starts licking nipples, making “Yum!” or “Eww!” sounds throughout.
CONTESTANT#1:	Ooh, I like this one! The Schnozzberries taste like schnozzberries!
DARE:		Great job, contestant #1! As a prize for your dare victory, you win… this box of breath mints!
	DARE hands CONTESTANT #1 a box of breath minds, CONTESTANT#1 rejoins the audience.
DARE:		And now, this sexy lady next to me would like to ask one of you for a truth! Are any of you up to the challenge?
	KOZ stands up and approaches the twins.
KOZ:	Oh, I got this.
TRUTH:	Alright, I need you to dig deep into your memory… you must tell us your most surprising, your most shocking secret!
KOZ:	Alright. Just so you know, I really deleted hypothetical.
AUDIENCE: (yelling)	WE KNOW!
KOZ:	Wellll, I wasn’t really mugged last summer. I had RedTele the whole time.
AUDIENCE: (yelling)	WE KNOW THAT TOO!
KOZ: (taken aback)	Ohhh-kay then… so the reason I booked that shitty band to play at the High Dive every Thursday after games was because… it’s the only way I can get hard.
	KIM stands up.
KIM: (yelling)	GEEZ WE KNOW ALREADY! JUST SIT DOWN!
TRUTH:	I’m sorry, but it looks like your deepest, darkest secrets… are really boring. You have failed to tell a surprising truth, so you don’t win anything at all.
	KYLE dejectedly sits back down with the AUDIENCE.
TRUTH:	Now, who would like to come up and receive a dare from my spectacular sibling?
	CONTESTANT#3 stands up and runs up to the twins.
CONTESTANT#3:	Me, mememememe!
	An alarm or bell rings.
DARE:		Oh, you lucky ducky! We’re almost out of time, so you get… THE TRIPLE DONG DARE!
	SOMEONE excitedly runs in with three stuffed dogs sewn or tied together.
SOMEONE:	Did you say… the triple dog dare?
TRUTH:	No, she didn’t. Sorry.
	FERGIE runs on shirtless, carrying three bongs while SOMEONE dejectedly walks back off stage.
FERGIE:	Did I hear someone say “Triple Bong Bear”?
DARE:		No you did not. Please go away.
FERGIE:	Awwwww…
	FERGIE dejectedly walks off and hands the loaded bongs out to the real audience.
DARE:		Now, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, are you prepared for… THE TRIPLE DONG DARE?
	TRUTH and DARE unveil the glory hole. Three PENIS SOCK PUPPETS emerge flaccidly.
BARRY:	Awwww, fuck! I picked the wrong year to quit kickball!
	BARRY jumps up and shoves CONTESTANT #3 out of the way, and starts going at the PENIS SUCK PUPPETS. As he does, each becomes erect and they start singing.
PENISES:	Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the hole
		It is waiting hard and ready for you to come and adore
		And if you do a good job then a surprise will be in store
		The Circus Marches On
	As the PENIS SOCK PUPPETS sing the chorus, BARRY grabs two by the balls. As he grabs each one, it starts singing soprano. Then he starts jerking off the third, and it ejaculates silly string on the last line.
		Glory, glory hole-a-lujah! 
		Glory, glory hole-a-lujah!
		Glory, glory hole-a-lujah!
		The Circus Marches On

(END)
